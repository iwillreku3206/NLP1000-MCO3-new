1233151,"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.",O yamalavat rana ngarangaran do jya am ineynapo na ni Yeso Kizisto a sivovoong na ni Tawey. Si Tawey am sivovoong na ni Apolahan.
1233152,Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; ,O anak na ni Apolahan am si Isa. O anak na ni Isa am si Yakebo. O anak na ni Yakebo am si Yoda kano kakakteh na. 
1233153,and Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; ,O anak na ni Yoda kani Tama am si Veyletse a kani Syala. O anak na ni Veyletse am si Heselon. O anak na ni Heselon am si Yalan. 
1233154,and Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; ,O anak na ni Yalan am si Aminata. O anak na ni Aminata am si Nason. O anak na ni Nason am si Saarmen. 
1233155,and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; ,O anak na ni Saarmen a kani Laha am si Poatse. O anak na ni Poatse a kani Lote am si Opeyte. O anak na ni Opeyte am si Yesi. 
1233156,and Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; ,O anak na ni Yesi am si Tawey. O anak na ni Tawey am si Solomen. O ina na am mina mavakes na ni Odiya. 
1233157,and Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; ,O anak na ni Solomen am si Lopoan. O anak na ni Lopoan am si Apiya. O anak na ni Apiya am si Yasa. 
1233158,and Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; ,O anak na ni Yasa am si Yesava. O anak na ni Yesava am si Yelan. O anak na ni Yelan am si Ociya. 
1233159,and Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; ,O anak na ni Ociya am si Yetan. O anak na ni Yetan am si Ahatse. O anak na ni Ahatse am si Sisicya. 
1233160,and Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; ,O anak na ni Sisicya am si Manase. O anak na ni Manase am si Amen. O anak na ni Amen am si Yeseya. 
1233161,"and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: ",No karakep da so Isedi a tao a yangay do Papilon am meytaodtod si Yeseya. O anak na am si Yoyacin a kano kakakteh na.
1233162,"and after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; ",Yangay da sira do Papilon am meytaodtod si Yekeniya. O anak na am si Salati. O anak na ni Salati am si Solopapey. 
1233163,and Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; ,O anak na ni Solopapey am si Apio. O anak na ni Apio am si Idiacing. O anak na ni Idiacing am si Aso. 
1233164,and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; ,O anak na ni Aso am si Sato. O anak na ni Sato am si Asin. O anak na ni Asin am si Idio. 
1233165,and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; ,O anak na ni Idio am si Idiasa. O anak na ni Idiasa am si Matan. O anak na ni Matan am si Yakebo. 
1233166,"and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.",O anak na ni Yakebo am si Yoseyvo a kahanghangan ni Madiya. O meyngaran si Yeso am anak na ni Madiya. Si Yeso am Misayya.
1233167,So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.,"No ko vilangan am no yapwen ji Apolahan a kangay na ji Tawey am apat o ikarwa na (14) no katatapilan da rana. No yapwen ji Tawey a kangay na do nirakpan da so Isedi a yangay do Papilon am akman sang a apat so ikarwa (14) so katatapilan sira. No vilangan o niyan da no Isedi a tao do Papilon a kangay na do cinatazak na no Misayya am akman sang, ta apat so ikarwa (14) o katatapilan da."
1233168,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. ","Kasasaodan ni Yeso Kizisto no katazak na. Si Madiya a ina na a nitamtamkan ni Yoseyvo am ji pa nizomagpit do vahay da am katenngan na rana ni Madiya o kapangalavat na so metdeh, do kowyat na jya no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to. "
1233169,"Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. ",O mangay na seksekan a tao a meyngaran so Yoseyvo am tey yapya o ahahapan na so vazay na do icyatatao na. Am ori o naknakman na sya do onowned na so kato na rana ngaolyan so tamtamek da. Ta ji nakzan o kapeyrengerengay da jya no tao a katenngan. 
1233170,"But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. ","Naknakmen na o akman sang a vazay am mangay na patateynepan no tinsi ni Ama ta do to. Maniring am, ""Mo Yoseyvo a sivovoong ni Tawey, ji ka nyahey. Ta ahapen mo si Madiya kataned mo do vahay. Ta o na alavaten am yapo do Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to. "
1233171,"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. ","Si Madiya am mangahanas so mahakay. No si malikey am ingaran mo jya si Yeso, ta iya o mapatastas so omraralay nya tao do peyraratenan da."" "
1233172,"Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, ","O aro a vazay eya am todey mangononong do mina ciring no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to. Ta o mina ciring na am, "
1233173,"Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. ","""Amyan so ji meylimoteng so onowned a mavakes a mangalavat so mahakay. O ngaran na am Imaneydi."" O peypeypangayan na am, ""Macilovot jyaten si Ama ta do to."""
1233174,"Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: ",Mayokay si Yoseyvo am to na mangozai o mina ciring na jya no tinsi na ni Ama ta do to a mapasakay si Madiya. 
1233175,and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.,Am no kaji na pa tazakan no kanakan a mahakay am ji pa nimacitovong si Yoseyvo ji Madiya. Matazak rana a tao o kanakan am ngaranan na ni Yoseyvo a si Yeso.
1233176,"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Jud&#230; a in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, ",No kapeypanirsirngen da pa si Helote am matazak a tao si Yeso do Podiheng a ili do Yotay. O manitanita rana so mata no hanit a nimapo do teyhesa ka ili am mangay sira do Yelosaleng. 
1233177,"saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.","Maniring sira am, ""Wanjin jya o nimatazak a tao a panirsirngen no tao do Yotay. Ta namen nimacita o mata no hanit do daddan no araw a yongkad no kanimatazak na rana. Ori o namen nyai a yaomraralay nya."" "
1233178,"When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. ",Mamizing na no panirsirngen a meyngaran si Helote am marahet o onowned na. Akman sang sira o tao do Yelosaleng a mamogaw. 
1233179,"And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. ","Makarahan am lovoten na ni Helote o panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano mangnanao no iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to. Maniring jira am, ""Do wanjin o na katazakan no Misayya a ipanci da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to no kakwa."" "
1233180,"And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Jud&#230; a: for thus it is written by the prophet, ","Maniring sira am, ""Do Podiheng a ili do Yotay. Ta o yadomket a ciriciring da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to am, "
1233181,"And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, Art not the least among the princes of Juda: For out of thee shall come a Governor, That shall rule my people Israel.","'Inyo rana tao a meyvahay do Podiheng a macinapnap do Yotay am tana ney likey na o ili nyo am ney manhama kamo a tao. Ta amyan jinyo so asa ka tao a makayokod ninyo a Isedi a tao.'"""
1233182,"Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.",Makarahan am lovoten na ni Helote a panirsirngen o manitanita so mata no hanit a tao a kapanahes na nya jira so araraw na no nipeytotwaw no mata no hanit ang. 
1233183,"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. ","Makarahan am ipanci na sira mangay do Podiheng. Maniring jira am, ""Pakapyahen nyo pala kalahen o kanakan ang. Si makala nyo am ipanci nyo jyaken, ta mangay ko a iraralay."""
1233184,"When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. ",Mamizing da o ciring na am mangay rana sira. Makarahan am to da cita pa tomwaw o mata no hanit a nimacita da do daddan no araw a meypalanginan nira to meynonozey a mangay a someyked do nikatazakan a tao no kanakan ang. 
1233185,"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.",So nisaray da makacita so mata no hanit ang.
1233186,"And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. ",Somdep sira do vahay am macita da o kanakan a kano ina na si Madiya. Am ori o nilogod da amraralay no kanakan ang. Makarahan am babahen da rana o nipalolo da ovay a kano mahangno a haneng a kano makdeng a kosozi a yazaw da sya. 
1233187,"And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.","Meysinaoli sira o manitanita so mata no hanit a tao am patareken na o rarahan da ni Ama ta do to, do kanimapatateynep na jira a jyangay ji Helote a panirsirngen."
1233188,"And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. ","Mangay rana sira am patateynepan na si Yoseyvo no tinsi ni Ama ta do to. Maniring jya am, ""Peyvangon rana kangay mo nira meyina a somazok do Ayci, kato nyo ngyanan dang a meyvahay mangay no ipanci ko na inyo a komaro do dang. Ta si Helote am na kalahen o kanakan a yawakwaken."" "
1233189,"When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: ","Am ori o nyangayan na ni Yoseyvo nira meyina do Ayci a meyvahay do dang, "
1233190,"and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.","mangay do nikawakwak ni Helote. O icyakman na sang no vazay am pangononongan na o mina ciring no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to. Ta maniring am, ""Nipeysinaoli ko o anak ko a apo do Ayci."""
1233191,"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men. ","Katenngan ni Helote o kanimlita da jya no manitanita so mata no hanit am meyoyaoya.

"
1233192,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, ","O icyakman na sang am todey mangononong o mina ciring no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a meyngaran so Yedimi. Ta maniring am, "
1233193,"In Rama was there a voice heard, Lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, And would not be comforted, because they are not.","""Makamizing do Lama so sivosivovoong ni Reyci a omlololos a amlavi do ananak da a jya nimakey a padnadnahen da so pahad, do kanimamimin no anak da niwakwak da."""
1233194,"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, ",Mawakwak si Helote am patateynepan no tinsi ni Ama ta do to si Yoseyvo do Ayci. 
1233195,"saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. ","Maniring jya am, ""Peyvangon rana, kangay mo nira meyina do Isedi. Ta yarana nimawakwak o yapwa amwakwak si Yeso."" "
1233196,"And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. ",Makarahan am ipeysinaoli na rana ni Yoseyvo sira meyina yangay do Isedi. 
1233197,"But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Jud&#230; a in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: ","Ikongo do nimamizing na o anak ni Helote a meyngaran so Acilaw a omlit do ama na a panirsirngen no Yotay, am ori o ji na nimangai do Isedi. Am ori o nipatateynepan na pa ji Yoseyvo ni Ama ta do to. So nipananawan na no angayan da. Ori o nyangay da tomayo do Cyadidi. "
1233198,"and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.","O meyngaran so Nasale a ili am ori rana o nikaplinan da meyvahay. O icyakman na sang no vazay am todey mangononong o mina ciring no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to. Ta maniring sira am, ""Iya rana am ngaranan da tao do Nasale."""
1233199,"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Jud&#230; a, ",No kano nang am nimangay o nimanaktak a si Yowani do kabwan no nihakawan no tao do Yotay a mangnanao. 
1233200,"and saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. ","Maniring am, ""Mamlis kamo na, ta yarana makeykai o na katalamozong ninyo ni Ama ta do to."" "
1233201,"For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.","O mina ciring no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a meyngaran so Isayya am si Yowani o peycirngan na sya. Ta maniring am, ""Amyan so tao a amlololos do kabwan no nihakawan no tao a manci no, 'Inyo rana am wadwaden nyo o rarahan no Panirsirngen ta. So katazineng na rana no pangonongan na.'"""
1233202,"And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. ",O ayob na ni Yowani am niparing a bobow no baka. O abtek na am kolit no baka. O kanen na am zozon a kano maganinem a amyan do vahay no tapipi. 
1233203,"Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Jud&#230; a, and all the region round about Jordan, ",Nimai pa sira o tao a apo do Yelosaleng a kado peycyeylilyan na do Yotay a kano macisngen so ili do ayo a meyngaran so Yotan a malovot do tangain na. 
1233204,"and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.",Ipanci da o raraten da. Am ori o nitaktakan na jira ni Yowani do meyngaran so Yotan a ayo.
1233205,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? ","Macita ni Yowani o aro a tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano macyagom do Satokay a mai a manci ni Yowani a tomaktak jira am pamizngen na sira. Maniring jira am, ""Inyo a yakmey mavowaw, sino ipanci jinyo o yanyo katayo no oyaoya na ninyo ni Ama ta do to. "
1233206,Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: ,Ta si mamlis kamo na so icicirawat am ori o ikanoyong nyo rana yana nikomaro do peyraratenan nyo. 
1233207,"and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. ","Ji nyo mancyan o kapakaliklik nyo so peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to, do nyo kapeyineynapo si Apolahan. To ko na macitangayan jinyo am makamaog si Ama ta do to do vato ito so sivosivovoong na ni Apolahan. "
1233208,"And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. ",Yana mazomtad o zaig do atngeh no kayo. O ji malasi a kayo am miminen na atbahen a kapasleb na sya do apoy.
1233209,"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: ",Ko taktakan inyo no ranom do nyo na kapamlis. Am o manownowji pa ka nyaken a yamai am taktakan na inyo no Seyzi a kano apoy. So ikaizaizay na pa ka nyaken. So ji ko macingai jya. 
1233210,"whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.","Yamyan do lima na so ipaninigi. So cigyan na so kadai a kapangay na so pipya kadai do peyvokavokan, kasleb na so ata na do jyahesep a lila no apoy."""
1233211,"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. ",No kanang am nimapo si Yeso do Cyadidi a kapeypangay na do Yotan a ayo a mangay ji Yowani a manci nya tomaktak jya. 
1233212,"But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? ","Am naknakmen ni Yowani o kazazat na do nakenakem ni Yeso. Maniring ji Yeso am, ""Beken a yaken o taktakan mo a. Ikongo mo yai jyaken."" "
1233213,"And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. ","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""To ta macyozai o akman sya vazay an. Ta o ikakman na sya am ahapen ta o vazay ni Ama ta do to."" Makarahan am to na rana amya ni Yowani a taktakan si Yeso. "
1233214,"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: ",Meypapowpow si Yeso apo do ranom am todacyangi o hanit. So nipakacita na so Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to a akmey hato a meyhekas a someyked do kataotao na. 
1233215,"and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.","Meyratateng am amyan so ciring a apo do teyngato. Maniring am, ""Iya rana ya am Anak ko a ko tey kaglaw. So yako sarayan nya."""
1233216,Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. ,Makarahan am ipeypalanginan no Seyzi si Yeso a yangay do kabwan no nihakawan no tao a littan ni Satan. 
1233217,"And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. ",Makasikapat (40) so araraw si Yeso a jya nikoman am maliliw na o kakcin na. 
1233218,"And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. ","Ori o nyangay ni Satan ji Yeso. Maniring jya am, ""No ka manoyong a Anak no Tao do to am pancyan pala o aro a vato a kapeyvaliw na a myanpaw."" "
1233219,"But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.","Tovisan ni Yeso am, ""O ciring do Seysyo am, 'Beken a kanehen o ikavyay no tao, ta makdekdeng pa o Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a ikavyay no tao.'"""
1233220,"Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, ",Makarahan am yangay na pa ni Satan si Yeso do Yelosaleng a kangay na nya do toktok na no rako a panaralayan da. 
1233221,"and saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: And in their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.","Maniring jya am, ""No ka manoyong a Anak no Tao do to am okso pala do teyrahem ito.

1233222,"Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.","Tovisan ni Yeso am, ""O ciring do Seysyo am, 'Ji nyo ngileylamdama o Panirsirngen nyo a Tao do to nyo.'"""
1233223,"Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; ",Am ori o nitanggahan na ni Yeso ni Satan do makarang a tokon a kapacita na no peykamahamahatawan na kano aro a masamasaod no karawan. 
1233224,"and saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. ","Maniring si Satan am, ""No si meylilitod ka amraralay nyaken am to ko na mimina o makakaday a itoro jimo."" "
1233225,"Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.","Tovisan ni Yeso am, ""Angay rana mo Satan! Ta o ciring do Seysyo am, 'Iraralay nyo o Panirsirngen a Tao do to nyo. So ika iya na no iraralay nyo. Ta abo o ikararwa na a iraralay nyo an.'"""
1233226,"Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.",Makarahan am karwan na rana si Yeso ni Satan a kai no aro a tinsi ni Ama ta do to a somidong sya.
1233227,"Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; ",Mamizing na ni Yeso si Yowani a nipteng da do pamemtengan am meysinaoli do Cyadidi. 
1233228,"and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: ","Am ji rana meyvahay si Yeso do Nasale, ta nimangay rana a meyvahay do Cyapaynong.

1233229,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, ","O icyakman na sang am todey mangononong o ciring no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a meyngaran so Isayya. Ta maniring am, "

1233233,"And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. ",Mangonong si Yeso do pasalan no rako a meybebneng a ranom a ngaranan da Cyadidi am macita na o rarwa ka tao a mangahangahahap a ngaranan da si Pite a si Simong a kano kakteh na a meyngaran so Antele a amzoyo no tawaz da. 
1233234,"And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Macilolo kamo jyaken, ta nanawen ko inyo. So icyakma nyoy mangahahap a tao a mapanop so tao."" "
1233235,"And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. ",Mamizing da am to da rana ngaroi o tawaz da a macilolo ji Yeso.
1233236,"And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. ",Alikey pa o nyalaman na am macita na ni Yeso o anak na ni Sipitay a meyngaran so Yake a kano kakteh na si Yowani a kano ama da a si Sipitay a tomonod so nyayoma da tawaz do tatala da.

1233582,the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;,O nihakawan ori am karawan. O nitokos ori am monganay do italamozong ni Ama ta do to a tao. O tamek am aro a tao a italamozong ni Satan. 
1233583,the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.,O mapasakoy so tamek a kavosoyan ori am si Satan. O peypeypangayan no mangay mangap rana sya ori am kavosan no karawan. O mangap sya a tao ori am tinsi. 
1233584,As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.,No komavos o karawan am o meyraraten a tao am akman sira so tamek ang a botboten a pasleben do lila no apoy. 
1233585,"The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;","Yaken rana a Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao am manovoy ko so tinsi a mangay omrakep so tomirara so tao a meyraraten a kano marahet so ahahapan sya, "
1233586,and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.,a kapasleb ko sira do apoy a kapeylavilavi da a mapeygazicigit so ngepen da a maneneseh. 
1233587,"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.","No si marateng rana ori am o ji meylimoteng so nakem do italamozong ni Ama ta do to am akman sira so araw a maniray. So amizngan nyo sya an, peyyanen nyo do onowned nyo ori an."
1233588,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.","""O italamozong na ni Ama ta do to am akman so ovay a nibobo do tana.

1233589,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:","""O italamozong na ni Ama ta do to am akman so tao a meykala so mazaponay a sazangan na. "
1233590,"who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.",No makakala so mazaponay am ipamalit na o kangangay na so nizpi a mangay na isazang do mazaponay ang.
1233591,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:","""O italamozong na ni Ama ta do to am akman so tawaz a pazaten do awa a ipanawaz so makakaday a among. "
1233592,"which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.",No aro rana o among am ngingiten da rana no mangahahap a tao a kapeykapyapinpin da sya do pamsan na.

1233595,"Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. ","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Nyo mamimin o ciring eya yakatenngan?"" Maniring sira am, ""Namen todamimin a yakatenngan."" "
1233596,"Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""O mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a tao a kapacikaop na rana do italamozong ni Ama ta do to am akman so katenngan a tao a aro so peymeymasaodan.

1233597,"And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.","Teyka na ni Yeso o aro a pehngehngayan na so ciring na a ipanci am karwan na do dang, "
1233598,"And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? ","a kangay na rana do ili da. So nipangnanao na do peyneynozyan no tao. Abo ji meyzokab no ciring na a makamizing sya tao. Maniring sira am, ""Do wanjin na niyapwan no teneng na ya.

1233599,"Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? ",Beken a anak na ori no meykeykawaz asyo? Beken a ina na si Madiya asyo? Beken a wari na si Yake a kani Yoseyvo a kani Simong a kani Yota asyo? 
1233600,"And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? ","Da kapacikeylyan jyaten da wari na mavakes asyo. Am do wanjin na kapwan no oyowyat na kano teneteneng na."" "
1233601,"And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.","Makarahan am ikaoya da rana si Yeso. Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""O panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to am ikanig da sira no tao do peycyeylilyan na. Am kolalahen da sira no macikeylyan jya kano pacivahayan da tao."" "
1233602,And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.,"Ikongo do ji da nganoyngi si Yeso, am ori o ji na nimeyvazai so aro a mapeyzokab a vazay do dang."
1233603,"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, ",No kanang am o panirsirngen no Cyadidi a meyngaran so Helote am mamizing na o vazay ni Yeso. 
1233604,"and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.","Maniring do lamlamsoy na am, ""Ala nimanaktak a si Yowani o tao ori a yanimirwa a mavyay. Am ori o na ikatey mowyat a yamapeyvazay so yamapeyzokab a vazay."" "
1233605,"For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. ","O cinawakwak na ni Yowani am o panirsirngen a meyngaran so Helote am to ney mehsa o mavakes no kakteh na a meyngaran so Veydipo. O ngaran no mavakes am si Helotiya.

1233606,"And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. ",Ori o naknakman na sya ni Helote si Yowani a wakwaken. Am ikanyahey na o aro a tao. Ta ipanci da si Yowani a panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to.
1233607,"But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. ",Araraw no cinatazak na tao ni Helote am maganam o anak na mavakes ni Helotiya do tangain no nipanoyon na tao. Ikakza ni Helote o ganam na. 
1233608,Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. ,"Maniring rana si Helote do maganam a mavakes am, ""No amyan so amin mo jyaken am cyaha, ta itoro ko jimo."" "
1233609,"And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. ","Ikongo do nyahes na no ina na o anak na, am ori o nipancyan na no, ""Oo no nimanaktak a si Yowani a pangain do kakanan a itoro mo jyaken."" "
1233610,"And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. ","Makarahan am ji rana teneng a manakenakem o panirsirngen ang, do kanimapanmanma na so ciring na do tangain no nipanoyon na a tao. Am ori o to na rana myapyai so amin na jya itoro jya. "
1233611,"And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. ","Makarahan am mapahanhan rana so tao a mangay do pamemtengan a motow do oo na ni Yowani, "
1233612,"And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. ",kapangay na rana sya do kakanan a itoro do anak ni Helotiya. Ahapen no mavakes ori am itoro na ji ina na. 
1233613,"And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.","O macinanao ji Yowani am mangay da pingsanan o kataotao ni Yowani, kangay da rana mapakakasa sya. Meyratateng am mangay rana sira a manci nya ji Yeso."
1233614,"When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. ",Mamizing na ni Yeso o kanimawakwak na ni Yowani am omavang do vazangay a kano macinanao jya a komaro do dang a kaveyvow na mangay do kabwan no tao. Katenngan da no aro a tao am omalam sira a apo do peycyeylilyan na a omonot jya. 
1233615,"And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.",Makaranes si Yeso do pamsan na am macita na o aro a tao. So nikarilawan na nira. Am ori o niwakwakan na do ingingnen da no meyngen a tao. 
1233616,"And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. ","Maseyrem rana am mai sira o macinanao ji Yeso. Maniring sira am, ""Yatey mahep rana. Yabo pa do jya o tao a yameyvahay. So to ta na novoi sira kangay da manazang so kanen da do ili."" "
1233617,"But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Cyaha, ji nyo novoya sira. Pantan kamo sira so kanen da."" "
1233618,"And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. ","Maniring sira o macinanao jya am, ""Yalima ka myanpaw a kano yadwa ka among o yamyan jyamen do jya."" "
1233619,"He said, Bring them hither to me.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Inney kamo."" "
1233620,"And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. ",Makarahan am ipanci na sira o tao a amlisna do katamtamkan a kahap na so alima ka myanpaw a kano adwa ka among a katangara na so hanit a somaray nya ji Ama ta do to a kakcikcil na so myanpaw a itoro do macinanao jya a kavonong da rana sya do aro a tao. 
1233621,"And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. ",So ikamimin da rana nikoman a mabsoy. Peysinsinmowen da rana o atda da am nipno da o adwa so ikarwa ka yala. 
1233622,"And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.",O vilang no tao a nikoman am kakaliman a ranaw (5000) sira. Am ji pa nipavilang sira o mavakes a kano kanakan.
1233623,"And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. ",Komavos ori am ipanci na rana ni Yeso o macinanao jya somakay do vazangay a mangay do katovangan na no rako a meybebneng a ranom. 
1233624,"And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. ",Teyka na taitaiden o aro a tao am maveyvow a mangay do tokon a meynozi. Mahep rana am amyan pa do dang. 
1233625,"But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. ","Am marai rana o vazangay do pamsan na. Ikongo do sangozen da, am ori o ikaligaligan no vazangay do kasangoz da sya. "
1233626,"And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. ",Toda jyadagdag rana am amyan si Yeso do rako a meybebneng a ranom a mangonong a meypangay do macinanao jya. 
1233627,"And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. ","Macita da no macinanao jya a omalam do ranom am ikanyahey da. Maniring sira am, ""Anito!"" kwan da a manyahey a amlololos. "
1233628,"But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Ji kamo anyahey, ta yaken."""
1233629,"And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. ","Maniring si Pite am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, no si Yeso ka am pancyan yaken a kalam ko do ranom a mangay jimo."" "
1233630,"And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. ","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Sijya."" Makarahan am gomcin si Pite do vazangay a kalam na do ranom a meypangay ji Yeso. "
1233631,"But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. ",Am macita na o omaopaong am to rana nyahey. Toda jingned am amlololos a manci ni Yeso do kahap na sya. 
1233632,"And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?","Makarahan am jya nimeyyahahay si Yeso a mangay komatkat sya. Maniring am, ""Yatey likey pa o onowned mo, ta mo ji meyhanhan nyaken. Ikongo o mo peykarwan so onowned mo a yaji meyhanhan nyaken."" "
1233633,"And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. ",Zomagpit rana sira do vazangay am irekhang na rana o pagpag. 
1233634,"Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.","O macikavang ji Yeso a macinanao jya am iraralay da rana si Yeso. Maniring sira am, ""Namen anoyngan imo a Anak ni Ama ta do to."""
1233635,"And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. ",Makaranes sira do katovangan no rako a meybebneng a ranom am mangid sira do Kenisale. 
1233636,"And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; ",Masingkad da si Yeso no aro a tao do dang am manovoy sira so tao a mangay a mapeykatokatoyo so meykeyngeyngen a tao do manwanongnong a ili a kangay da nira do tangain ni Yeso. 
1233637,and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.,Ta no si ori pa o ipakapinan da do ayob ni Yeso. Ta o minan do ayob ni Yeso a tao am todapya rana sira.
1233638,"Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, ","Amyan so tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a nimapo do Yelosaleng a mangay ji Yeso. Maniring sira jya am, "
1233639,Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. ,"""Ikongo da ji ngapi so iwawalam no ineynapo ta no macinanao jimo, do da kaji mavanawan no omanam sira a koman."" "
1233640,"But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Ikongo nyo apyapyan pa so Ciriciring ni Ama ta do to a yataosyahen a yanyo kahap so iwawalam no ineynapo nyo. "
1233641,"For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.","No maniring si Ama ta do to am, 'Ikaglaw nyo a ikanig o inyapwan nyo.' Maniring pa am, 'O omavay so inyapwan na am to rana wakwaka.'"
1233642,"But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;","Am nyo kajya pasovoyan a amya so tao a jyaglaw no inyapwan na. O ciring nyo am, 'No myan so tao a tomoro nya do Tao do to so ipakan na so inyapwan na am apyapya o kaji na rana pakanan so inyapwan na.' "
1233643,"and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.","Nyo tongbowa no iwawalam nyo o Ciriciring ni Ama ta do to, do yanyo kapyapya pa so iwawalam no ineynapo nyo. "
1233644,"Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, ","Inyo rana yatanwasiwasi am yamanoyong o ciring no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a meyngaran so Isayya a pakacirngen na jinyo. Ta maniring am, "
1233645,"This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.",'O aro a tao am da admadmain yaken no ciring da. Am onowned da am yameyparai jyaken.
1233646,"But in vain they do worship me, Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.","Da ipanci o ciring no tao a ciring ko. So yana ikabo no peypeypangayan no da kararalay nyaken.'"""
1233647,"And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:","Lovoten na ni Yeso o aro a tao do tangain na am maniring jira am, ""Amizngen nyo a kapakateneng nyo jya. "
1233648,"not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.","O apo do ngoso no tao a mangay do velek am ji mapeyraraten so tao, ta o makowbot do ngoso a apo do onowned am ori o mapeyraraten so tao."""
1233649,"Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? ","Makarahan am maniring sira o macinanao ji Yeso am, ""Da mamizing no tao a macyagom do Vadisay o ciring mo am sira ji makamyamya. Manngwa, mo katenngan an?"" "
1233650,"But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""O ji na nipamowa ni Ama ta do to a mowamowa am miminen ori a botboten. "
1233651,"Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.","Ji nyo ngazidan sira, ta sira rana am kapalangayan da o mavota tao a mangonong no tao. No mangalay so mavota o mavota tao am mangay o kangay da matazangeb no rarwa ang."""
1233652,"Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. ","Maniring si Pite am, ""Ipanci mo pa jyamen o peypeypangayan no mo pehngehngain a ciring mo ang."" "
1233653,"And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Kamo pa meyyangay a kano karwan no tao a yaji makateneng jya sicyaikwaya? "
1233654,"Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?","Manngwa, nyo jyatenngi o isovo a kanen am mangay do velek a kapeywadwad rana nya? "
1233655,But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.,Am o makowbot do ngoso am apo do onowned. Ori o mapeyraraten so tao. 
1233656,"For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:","O mapo do onowned am amyan dang so makakaday a nakenakem no tao a ipeyraraten a mangap so tao, mangzakza, manakaw, mangalalas, manamwad. "
1233657,these are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.,"O yamakakaday ori am manoyong ori a mapeyraraten so tao. Am o ji mavanaw a koman am ji mapeyraraten so tao o akman sang."""
1233658,"Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. ",Karwan na do dang ni Yeso am mangay do meyngaran so Tayar a kano Siton a ili. 
1233659,"And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. ","Amyan dang so asa ka mavakes a tao do Cyanan a mangay ji Yeso.

1233660,"But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. ","Abo o asa ka ciring a nitovis na jya ni Yeso. Mai sira o macinanao jya am mapasyasi sira ji Yeso. Maniring sira am, ""Tovoy rana o mavakes ang, ta yamanilo a yaomonot jyaten."" "
1233661,"But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","Maniring si Yeso do mavakes am, ""O na pahanhanan jyaken ni Ama ta do to am ko sidongen o Isedi a tao a yakmey nimavozaw a kagling na."" "
1233662,"Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. ","Mamizing na o ciring ni Yeso am meylilitod do tangain na. Maniring am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, sidongen mo pa yaken."" "
1233663,"But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""No ahapen o kanen no anak a itoro do ino am malas o akman sang."" "
1233664,"And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. ","Maniring o mavakes am, ""Yamanoyong ori mo Panirsirngen. Am o meycyakakas do nyakanan da no mapavahay sya am kanen no ino."" "
1233665,"Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Mo kavakes, yatey arako o nakenakem mo si Ama ta do to. So to na rana mangononongi no mo kakdain ang."" So nikapya na rana no anak na no kapanci na nya ni Yeso."
1233666,"And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. ",Karwan na do dang ni Yeso am mangay do pamsan no rako a meybebneng a ranom a meyngaran so Cyadidi. So nyangay na do tokon a kahezsad na do dang. 
1233667,"And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: ",Aro tao a komala pa sya. Sira rana am nipalolo da o mapilay a kano mavota kano nimakasapa kano ji makabnebnek a kano makasazi so meycyamadadayan a ingingnen a yangay do tangain na ni Yeso. So niteyteyhesan na sira niwakwakan ni Yeso. 
1233668,"insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.",Macita da no aro a tao o ji makabnebnek a kano nimakasapa kano mapilay a kano mavota a to rana apya am isavasavak da. So nyazwazwayan da rana so Tao do to da no Isedi a tao.
1233669,"Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.","Rarahen na ni Yeso sira o macinanao jya.

1233670,"And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? ","Maniring sira o macinanao jya am, ""Do wanjin o angayan namen a pangapan so kanen a ibsoy ta so aro a tao, do yabo panazangan do jya."" "
1233671,"And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. ","Maniring jira si Yeso am, ""Yapira o myanpaw a yamyan jinyo."" Maniring sira am, ""Yapito a ka myanpaw a kano yapeleh a lilikta among."" "
1233672,And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. ,"Makarahan am ipanci na rana ni Yeso o aro a tao a amlisna, "
1233673,"And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

1233676,"And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.","Makarahan am tovoin na rana sira o aro a tao a mangay rana, a kazagpit na rana do vazangay a meypangay do Macyatan a ili."
1233677,"The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. ",Amyan so tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano macyagom do Satokay a mangay ji Yeso a omnakenakem so keyleylamdam da sya.

1233679,"And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?","Apnezak pa am ipanci nyo na o kacimoy na kasazowsaw na sicyaraw, do kakedep na.

1233680,"A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. ","Yateywara o raraten no tao sicyaikwaya, do da kapasagpyan so aktokto da. Nyo kakzeben o kapakacita nyo so oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to.

1233681,"And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.",Makaranes sira do katovangan no rako a meybebneng a ranom am nikahamangan da o kapalolo da so myanpaw no macinanao ji Yeso. 
1233682,"Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Azimanen nyo o akmey kosozi no odong a yamyan do tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano macyagom do Satokay."" "
1233683,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread. ","Ikazyak da no macinanao o ciring ni Yeso ang. Maniring sira do kadwan jira am, ""Ala ta kajya nimapalolwan so kanen ta o na peycirngan so sang ang!"" "
1233684,"Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?","Ikongo do katenngan na rana ni Yeso o ipanci da, am ori o nipancyan na nya jira so, ""Ikongo nyo kazyakan no nyo kajya nimapalolwan so kanen.

1233685,"Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?","Manngwa, nyo jyazab?

1233686,"Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?",A kano apito a ka myanpaw a nibsoy ko so kakapatan a ranaw (4000) a tao. Apira ka yala o nipeysinsinmo nyo a nimapanpan. 
1233687,"How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?","Ikongo nyo pa ji makatenngi do nipanci ko na jinyo. Beken a ko pagazen do myanpaw o ciring ko, ta ko pagazen do marahet a onowned da no tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano macyagom do Satokay."" "
1233688,"Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.",Ori o nipakatenngan da rana ji Yeso no macinanao jya do kaji na ngaingan do kosozi no odong. Ta pakacirngen na do marahet a nanao da no tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano macyagom do Satokay.
1233689,"When Jesus came into the coasts of C&#230; sarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?","To da ji makaranes si Yeso a kano macinanao jya do Kaysadiya Veydipi a ili am pacicin na o macinanao jya.

1233690,"And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. ","Maniring sira am, ""Yamyan so tao a yamanci nimo a nimanaktak a si Yowani. Yamyan so tao a yamanci nimo a Idiya. Yamyan so tao a yamanci nimo a Yedimi.

1233691,"He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Manngwa, sino kwan nyo yaken."" "
1233692,"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. ","Maniring si Simong Pite am, ""Imo rana am Misayya ka, Anak no yato meyyonong a mavyay a Tao do to."" "
1233693,"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Imo rana Simong a anak ni Yowani am ka tey yapya so ngilin.

1233694,"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.",To ko na macitangayan jimo am imo rana am si Pite ka.

1233696,Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.,Karahan am ipanci na ni Yeso do macinanao jya o kaji da meycicicyan nya do tao so ka Misayya na.
1233697,"From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. ",Nimacipinda no kanang o kato na rana mapazimakmakan so ciring na do macinanao jya a manci no kangay na do Yelosaleng.

1233698,"Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. ","Kalain ni Pite si Yeso a pasyain jira a omza sya. Maniring am, ""Ji kakman sang mo Panirsirngen. Jyabo kato ney meydednan jimo no akman sang a vazay a."" "
1233699,"But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.","Meyvazingowngaw si Yeso am maniring ji Pite am, ""Kazey mo Satan. Ta mo zazatan o ko pangonongan. Ta o nakenakem mo am beken a nakenakem ni Ama ta do to. Ta monganay do tao."""
1233700,"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.","Karahan am maniring si Yeso do macinanao jya am, ""No amyan so tao a omonot jyaken am to na pangawawan o kataotao na a somabway no jyojika na macihza jyaken. "
1233701,For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.,"Ta o amnakenakem so kataotao na am maraherahet, ta mawakwak ori. Am o tao a to ngawaw pa no kataotao na a mahap so vazay ko am mahap na o to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad na. "
1233702,"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?",Tana to na mimin o masaod no karawan na mahap a kaji na makahapan so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad na am ikongo peypeypangayan no akman sang. Ikongo pa o ipalit na pa so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad na. 
1233703,For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.,Yaken rana a Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao am maciralay ko do azwazway na ni Ama kano aro a tinsi a meygegcin.

1233704,"Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.","To ko na macitangayan jinyo am o tao a yatomanek do jya am amyan jira ang so makapis pa jyaken a Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao a mai a tomalamozong no karawan, do ikamavyay da pa."""
1233705,"And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, ",Ikanem na araw am palolwen ni Yeso si Pite a kani Yake a kani Yowani a meyketeh a mangay do makarang a tokon. 
1233706,"and was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. ",No kanang am todablis o keyteytawan ni Yeso do tangain da. So nicyakma ney araw no moing na maniray. Akman sang o talili na. 
1233707,"And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. ","Makarahan am macita da no tatlo a ka macinanao jya si Moyse a kani Idiya a tao no kakwa pa, a macisirsiring ji Yeso. "
1233708,"Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. ","Maniring si Pite ji Yeso am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, yata tey yapya do jya. No si apyahen mo am to ko na mamaring do jya so atlo a ka sarwap, asa jimo a asa ji Moyse a asa ji Idiya."""
1233709,"While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. ","Ji na pa teyka ni Pite o ciring na am to ngyan so cinalab a ombengbeng sira a keyyan no ciring a maciralay do cinalab ang. Maniring am, ""Iya rana am ney kaglaw ko Anak ko. So sarayan ko nya.

1233710,"And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. ",Mamizing da o ciring no macinanao jya am to rana sira meyrorokma do teyrahem a manyahey. 
1233711,"And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.","Karahan am mangay jira si Yeso a mapadnadna so nakem da. Maniring am, ""Tanek kamo na. Ji kamo anyahey."" "
1233712,"And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.",Citahen da am si Yeso rana o macita da.
1233713,"And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.","Omosok sira apo do tokon am maniring jira si Yeso am, ""Do ji ko pa nimirwai a mavyay a Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao am ji nyo pa meycicicyan o yanyo nimacita vazay an."""
1233714,"And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? ","Karahan am pacicin da no macinanao jya si Yeso. Maniring sira am, ""Ikongo da pancyan nya no yamangnanao no iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to o kapanmanma na mai ni Idiya."" "
1233715,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Si Idiya rana am manmanma mai a mapeyyalalap so nakem no meykaoya tao. "
1233716,"But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.","Am ko ipanci pa jinyo am yarana nimai si Idiya am da jyatenngi no tao. Am ori o to da naziboi nya no tao. So ikakman na sang no Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao a peyraraheten da."" "
1233717,Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.,Ori rana o nipakateneng da rana jya no macinanao ji Yeso so pakacirngen na do nimanaktak a si Yowani.
1233718,"And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, ",Makaranes sira do aro a tao am amyan so asa ka tao a nimai a mangay meylilitod do tangain na ni Yeso. 
1233719,"Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. ","Maniring am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, ikarilaw mo pa o anak ko. Ta yamamezamezay. So na ipangasi a yamaleklektek do apoy a kado ranom. "
1233720,"And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. ","Nyangay ko na do macinanao jimo am ji da vonas jya."" "
1233721,"Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Kamo tey yalikey pa so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to a tao sicyaikwaya do yanyo kapeyraraten.

1233722,And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.,Karahan am ioya na o kalamsoyan ni Satan a kapakowbot na rana. So nikapiya na rana no anak na.
1233723,"Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? ","Karahan am pacicin da si Yeso no macinanao jya. Maniring sira am, ""Ikongo namen ji makavozwawi so kalamsoyan ni Satan ang."" "
1233724,"And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""O nyo ikakman sang am yaji makanet pa o nakenakem nyo si Ama ta do to.

1233725,Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.,"[To nyo peykakasa o onowned nyo a meynozi a ji mangakaday. Ta ori o ikavozwaw no akman so sang a kalamsoyan ni Satan.""]"
1233726,"And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:","Malovot o macinanao ji Yeso do Cyadidi am maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Itoro da o Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao do macioya jya tao, "
1233727,"and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.","a kawakwak da sya. Am ikatlo na araw am mirwa pa mavyay."" Mamizing da ori no macinanao jya am marahet sira so aktokto."
1233728,"And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? ","Makaranes si Yeso a kano macinanao jya do Cyapaynong am amyan so mangangap so deyking no rako a panaralayan a tao a mangay ji Pite. Maniring sira jya am, ""Manngwa, tomoro so deyking do rako a panaralayan o Sinsi nyo an?"" "
1233729,"He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?","Maniring si Pite jira am, ""Ta ji na noroi.""

1233730,"Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.","Maniring si Pite am, ""Mangap do karwan no tao."" Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""No ori o nakem mo am ji noroi saon o anak na am. "
1233731,"Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.","Am taosya o kakma tey mapasobsobna.

1233732,"At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? ","No kanang am pacicin da no macinanao si Yeso. Maniring sira jya am, ""Sino pakarakehen a tao do italamozong na ni Ama ta do to."" "
1233733,"And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, ",Karahan am manara si Yeso so asa ka kanakan a kapatanek na sya do tangain da. 
1233734,"and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""To ko na macitangayan jinyo am no si mamlis kamo akman so kanakan eya am ori o ipacikaop nyo do tao a italamozong na ni Ama ta do to.

1233739,"Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.","No si asa ka lima mo no beken a ai mo o ipeyraraten mo am to ranangteba kawalit nya.

1233742,For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.,[O Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao am nimai a mapatazadang so meyraraten a tao.]
1233743,"How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?","""Naknakmen nyo pala.

1233744,"And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.",To ko na macitangayan jinyo am no si makala na o nimavozaw a asa ka kagling am jyabo kaji na noyotan a makacita so nimavozaw a kagling a kano asyam so ipakapoo (99) a kagling a.

1233758,"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.",Ikarilaw no panirsirngen na am to na ranangbowa o nivood na jya a kapasaway na rana sya.
1233759,"But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.","""Makowbot o lamlamsoy na am masazi na o kararay na a nimamood jya so to makangarnan a nizpi.

1234026,"For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.","""O italamozong ni Ama ta do to am akman so asa ka tao a mangilili. Karahan am rarahen na o lamlamsoy na a katoro na no peymasaodan na jira. "
1234027,"And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.",To na palololwa do kowyowyat da pongden sira no nizpi na.

1234033,"His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","Maniring o lawpan am, 'Imo rana am ka tey yapya ipeyhanhan a lamlamsoy.

1234036,"Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:","""Mai o nipanta na so asa zivo am maniring do lawpan am, 'Ko imo katenngan a tey malanlansoken a tao.

1234059,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, ","Teyka na ni Yeso o ciring na am maniring do macinanao jya am, "
1234060,"Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.","""Nyo katenngan o na kadwa rana araw no yakapamaring so kanen do Iyeci. Mangay o kapanazang da no Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao a padketen do jyojika."""
1234061,"Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, ",No kano nang am o panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem a kano kamanrarakehan da am malovot sira meysirisiring do vahay no kabtekan da panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a meyngaran so Keyava. 
1234062,"and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. ",Naknakmen da o karakep da si Yeso a wakwaken da do ikabo no tao. 
1234063,"But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.","Am maniring sira am, ""Ji ta pa peyvazaya do ipamarimaring so kanen no tao, ta meyvonag sira o tao."""
1234064,"Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, ",Amyan si Yeso do Potani a ili am nimyan do vahay da da Simong. Iya o nimlabyab so kolit no kakwa. 
1234065,"there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. ",Amyan so asa ka mavakes a nimangai so asa ka tagaw a kapnowan no masingat a mahangno a haneng. Macihanghang jira koman si Yeso am paglowen na do oo ni Yeso.

1234067,"For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. ","ikongo peypeypangayan no akman sang. Jingbeywani o yatey masingat a haneng ang. Apyapya rana o kapamalit nya so nizpi a ipanidong so ikasi a tao."" "
1234068,"When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.","Maniring jira si Yeso do pakamizngan na sya am, ""Nyo kazyakan no mavakes ang. O vazay na jyaken am ney yapya na vazay. "
1234069,For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.,"Ta yamasangib sira o makasi a tao a yamacikaop jinyo. So ji na salici jinyo no kasidong nyo sira. Am yaken am ko jyasangib, ta yalikey rana o ipacikaop ko jinyo. "
1234070,"For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.",O na paglowan do oo ko no mavakes so mahangno a haneng am yavat na ori do bobwan da jyaken. 
1234071,"Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.","To ko na macitangayan jinyo am no ipeylimwang o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to do karawan eya am abo ji makalavat so mina vazay na jyaken no mavakes eya."""
1234072,"Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, ",Amyan do rarwa so ikakarwan a macinanao ji Yeso so asa ka tao a meyngaran so Yota a tao do Isecyadi. Iya rana am nimangay do panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to. 
1234073,"and said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. ","Maniring am, ""No si itoro ko jinyo si Yeso am amyan so nakem nyo jyaken an?"" Karahan am mangap sira so atlo a poo (30) a nizpi a itoro da jya. "
1234074,And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.,Nimacipinda do dang o ji na rana pehmai ji Yeso a itoro jira.
1234075,"Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? ","Omanam o kasaraw do ipamaring da so kanen a iyakan da so ji nimimway a pang am pacicin da si Yeso no macinanao jya.

1234076,"And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Angay kamo do ili.

1234077,And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.,Karahan am to da mangozai o ciring ni Yeso a somdep do vahay a mapeykakasa so yaven da.
1234078,"Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. ",Maseyrem am macihanghang si Yeso do rarwa so ikakarwan a macinanao jya. 
1234079,"And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.","Koman sira am maniring si Yeso jira am, ""To ko na macitangayan jinyo am yamyan jinyo so yasa ka tao a yamanazang nyaken."" "
1234080,"And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? ","Mamizing da ori am marahet o aktokto da no macinanao jya. Am ori o nikateyteyras da manangangay nya ji Yeso. Maniring sira am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, yaken ori an?"" "
1234081,"And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""O yamapazanod so lima na jyaken a yatomahem so kanen na do kakanan am iya ori o yamanazang nyaken. "
1234082,The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.,"Akman so ciring do Seysyo, ta mangay o kawakwak da so Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao.

1234083,"Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.","O manazang ni Yeso a tao a meyngaran so Yota am maniring am, ""Mo Mangnanao, yaken ori an?"" Maniring si Yeso am, ""Mo na to yoyoi o na ka imo."""
1234084,"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.","Koman sira am ahapen ni Yeso o pang a isaray na ji Ama ta do to a kakcikcil na sya a itoro do macinanao jya. Maniring am, ""Ahap kamo a kakan nyo sya, ta kataotao ko ya."" "
1234085,"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;","Makarahan am ahapen na o kopo a yanan no potaw cyo a isaray ji Ama ta do to a katoro na rana nya jira. Maniring am, ""To kamo a mimin a amyop sya. "
1234086,"for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.",Oya rana am rala ko a nimvoyog a omaing do aro a tao a omvonas so raraten da. O rala ko rana ya am yongkad nyo do vayo a pangozayan nyo a ciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1234087,"But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.","To ko na macitangayan jinyo am ji ko na ngyop so potaw cyo a mangay do araraw no ikeypirwa ko a macikaop jinyo do teyngato, no si papwen na ni Ama ta do to o katalamozong na no vayo a karawan."""
1234088,"And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. ",Meyyanwanood sira so asa ka anwanood a sarayan da ni Ama ta do to a kapakowbot da rana a mangay do meyngaran so Kanlan a tokon.
1234089,"Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.","Makarahan am maniring si Yeso do macinanao jya am, ""Sicyamahep eya am mamimin kamo a amlikolikod jyaken a peymakarwan.

1234090,"But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.","Am no si mirwa ko a mavyay am manmanma ko a ka ninyo a mangay do Cyadidi."" "
1234091,"Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. ","Maniring si Pite ji Yeso am, ""Tana peymakarwan da imo no karwan no tao am jyabo kakaro ko jimo a."" "
1234092,"Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.","Maniring si Yeso ji Pite am, ""To ko na macitangayan jimo am sicyamahep eya am no si omanam o manok a tomazokokok am ipitlo ka omalalas jyaken."" "
1234093,"Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.","Maniring si Pite am, ""Tana macizanod ko na jimo a mawakwak am jyabo kato ko ngalalasan jimo a."" O karwan da no macinanao jya am akman sang o ciring da."
1234094,"Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.","Nimangay si Yeso a kano macinanao jya do meyngaran so Kesimani. Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""To kamo ngyan do jya, ta mangay ko meynozi do kwang ito."" "
1234095,"And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. ",Karahan am palolwen na si Pite a kano rarwa ka anak no meyngaran so Sipitay. So niyapo na rana dang no keyngen na rana so onowned ni Yeso. 
1234096,"Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.","Maniring jira am, ""Yako toda jyangay so inawan a yamazabab so onowned. So ipacizanod nyo jyaken do jya meytataziman."" "
1234097,"And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.","Omalam a meypanam am meyrorokma. Maniring do inozi na am, ""Mo Ama, no si apyahen mo am ji mo norwan jyaken o yatey rako a alalaw ko. Am ji mo na mangozai o nakenakem ko, ta ahahapan mo na sya."""
1234098,"And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?","Meysinaoli a mangay do tatlo a ka macinanao jya am macita na sira mitkeh. Maniring ji Pite am, ""Manngwa, ji nyo nahap o asa ka vatvatek a ipacizanod nyo jyaken a meytataziman? "
1234099,"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.","Meytataziman kamo a meynozi an, ta kalittan kamo an. Tana nyo apyahen do onowned nyo am nyo jyapakongo o nyo kapeynozi."""
1234100,"He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.","Maniring do ipidwa na kangay a meynozi ni Yeso am, ""Mo Ama, no ji mo amya o alalaw ko a komaro jyaken am to mo na mangozai o nakenakem mo."" "
1234101,And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. ,"Meysinaoli do macinanao jya am macita na pa sira mitkeh, ta tey makaha rana sira. "
1234102,"And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. ",Karwan na sira am ikeypitlo na rana ori a mangay meynozi. To meyyangay o ciring na kano kapanmanma na meynozi. 
1234103,"Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Karahan am meysinaoli do macinanao jya am maniring am, ""Kamo pa mitkeh?

1234104,"Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.","Kayokay kamo na, ta mangay tamo na. Cita kamo o yamanazang nyaken a tao a yarana mai."""
1234105,"And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. ",Ji pa vitos o ciring na ni Yeso am mai rana si Yota a ikararwa da so ikakarwan no macinanao jya a kapacilolo da no aro a tao a meyhavit so takzes a kano sisipzot da kayo.

1234106,"Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. ","Amyan so nipaziman na sira no manazang ni Yeso a tao. Maniring am, ""O rapongen ko a tao am ori o rakpen nyo."" "
1234107,"And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. ","Makaranes si Yota am to meytopos a mangay do tangain ni Yeso. Maniring am, ""Mo Mangnanao, kokay."" Karahan am rapongen na rana si Yeso. "
1234108,"And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. ","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Mo kahakay, peyvazay rana o yamo ipeynanakem a vazay mo."" Karahan am paciralayan da na no tao a omrakep si Yeso. "
1234109,"And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. ",O nimacihza ji Yeso a tao am amyan jira so asa to rana ngahap so takzes na pacipasen do talinga na no lamlamsoy no panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kakas na no asa ka talinga na.

1234112,"But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?","Am ji kongmana so sang o nakem ko. Ta makongo so wanjin a yatodey mangononong do ciring a yadomket do Seysyo, do keyyan no makdeng a vazay a mangay jyaken."""
1234113,"In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.","Karahan am maniring si Yeso do aro a tao am, ""Kamo mapalolo so takzes a kano sisipzot a yamrakep jyaken?

1234114,"But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.","Am o na todey mangononongi no aro a vazay eya am manoyong o ciring da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to do Seysyo a yatodey mangononong."" Karahan am peykarokarwan da rana si Yeso no macinanao jya a meyvwak."
1234115,"And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. ",O nimrakep si Yeso a tao am yangay da si Yeso do vahay no panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a meyngaran so Keyava. Amyan sira do dang o mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan a meykaygi. 
1234116,"But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. ",To na macyazizazawi si Yeso ni Pite. Makaranes sira do tezantehed no vahay no panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am somdep si Pite a kapacihezsad na do pamzaten da tao a tomita so vazay da ji Yeso no aro a tao. 
1234117,"Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; ",O panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano aro a meykaygi a tao am meykala sira so tao a mangamaog so iraherahet da si Yeso a ciring a iwakwak da sya. 
1234118,"but found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, ","Tana aro tao a meykala so iraherahet sya am ji sya makakala. Mownay am maniring o rarwa ka tao am, "
1234119,"and said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. ","""Nipanci no tao ang o kabalinas na so yata raralayan ni Ama ta do to a kapatnek na rana sya do ikatlo na araw."" "
1234120,"And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? ","To rana meytatanek o panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to. Maniring ji Yeso am, ""Manngwa, yamyan so yamo pasapahen do ciring da no tao a yada iraherahet jimo ang?"" "
1234121,"But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. ","Am abo o asa ka ciring a pasapahen na jya ni Yeso. Ipirwa na pacicin no panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am maniring ji Yeso am, ""Ko na to mancyan o ngaran ni Ama ta do to a yamanci nimo a manci nya jyamen so manoyong rana ciring mo. Manngwa, manoyong ka ya Misayya, Anak na ni Ama ta do to an?"" "
1234122,"Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Yamanoyong o mo ipanci ang.

1234123,"Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. ","Mamizing na ori no panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am to na rana misipisinga o ayob na. Maniring am, ""Na to ngolala si Ama ta do to no ciring na. Taosya rana o kakala ta so karatan na. Tamo nimamimin a yanimakamizing so na iraherahet si Ama ta do to. "
1234124,"What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. ","Manngo kamo."" Maniring sira am, ""Na kakzeben na kawakwak."" "
1234125,"Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, ","Karahan am cicippan da o moing na a kapatoki da pa jya kasiplang da sya. Maniring sira am, "
1234126,"saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?","""Pancyaney, mo Misayya. Sino o yanimbakbak jimo ang."""
1234127,"Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. ","Amhezsad si Pite do pantaw am amyan so lamlamsoy da a mavakes a mangay jya. Maniring am, ""Imo asyo o yamacihcihza do tao do Cyadidi a Yeso?"" "
1234128,"But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. ","Maniring si Pite a omalalas jya do tangain no aro a tao am, ""Ko jyatenngi o mo ipanci ang."" "
1234129,"And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. ","Karahan am mangay do ngoso no pazezevngen am macita na pa no asa ka mavakes a lamlamsoy da. Maniring do aro a tao a amyan dang am, ""O tao eyto am kararay na ori no tao do Nasale a meyngaran si Yeso."" "
1234130,"And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. ","Maniring si Pite do ikeypirwa na omalalas jya am, ""Ko jyatenngi o tao a nyo ipanci ang."" "
1234131,"And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. ","Mownay am to da rana limota si Pite no meytatanek do dang a tao. Maniring sira ji Pite am, ""Ka manoyong a kararay da nira ori. Ta yameyyangay o ciriciring nyo."" "
1234132,"Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. ","Maniring si Pite am, ""Ko jyatenngi o tao ang. No yamalas o ciring ko am cyaha, ta amyan si Ama ta do to a mapasingsingkad jyaken."" Teyka na ori a ciring am tomazokokok o manok. "
1234133,"And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.","Karahan am manakem na rana ni Pite o mina ciring na ni Yeso a manci no, ""Do yanam no manok a tomazokokok am ipitlo ka omalalas jyaken."" Karahan am makowbot rana si Pite a kapeykaoo na omzezezeng rana amlavi."
1234134,"When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: ",Apnezak am malovot sira o panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan da no tao do Yotay a meykaygi no kawakwak da si Yeso. 
1234135,"and when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.",Ahapen da si Yeso am vaoden da yangay a itoro do panirsirngen da no Loma a meyngaran so Pilato.
1234136,"Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, ",Katenngan na rana si Yeso no nimanazang nya a meyngaran so Yota a wakwaken da am maneneseh rana. Karahan am mangay na paolin o atlo a poo (30) a nizpi do panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan da no tao do Yotay. 
1234137,"saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. ","Maniring am, ""Ko meyraraten a yatodey manazang no inawan no yabo so raraten a tao."" Maniring sira am, ""Vazay mo saon am. Namen macivazay jimo."" "
1234138,"And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. ",Karahan am iwalit na o nizpi do rako a panaralayan a kapakowbot na rana amvitkeh so kataotao na lalavicinen do kayo. 
1234139,"And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. ","O panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am peysinsinmowen da rana o nizpi. Maniring sira am, ""Ngina no inawan na ya. Am ori o ji palovoci sya do kingking a itoro ji Ama ta do to, ta marahet."" "
1234140,"And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. ",Meykaygi sira am akmey yasa sira ommya so kasazang da do nihakawan no meyteytanatana tao a mangay da bobwan no ji macikeylyan jira tao. 
1234141,"Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. ","So na todangai sicyaikwaya no yada pancyan no nihakawan ori a ""Nivoyogan no rala no tao."" "
1234142,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; ","O vazay rana ya am yatodey mangononong do mina ciring no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a meyngaran so Yedimi. Ta maniring am, ""Nyahap da o atlo a poo (30) a nizpi a nipamnekan da no Isedi a ipalit da so inawan no tao, "
1234143,"and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.","a nipamalit da so nihakawan no meyteytanatana tao. Ori rana am nakenakem na jyaken ori ni Ama ta do to."""
1234144,"And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.","Yangay da si Yeso do tangain ni Pilato. Maniring jya am, ""Manngwa, panirsirngen da imo no tao do Yotay?"" Maniring si Yeso am, ""Noon, manoyong ori."" "
1234145,"And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. ",O iraherahet da sya no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan am abo nipasapa na ni Yeso. 
1234146,"Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? ","Maniring si Pilato jya am, ""Yabo cicilwan mo do da iraherahet jimo a vazay ang?"" "
1234147,And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. ,Akman sang ta abo o asa ka ciring a pasapahen na ni Yeso. Ori o nisavasavakan na nya ni Pilato.
1234148,"Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. ",Mangday do Iyeci o kato na mangozayan jya no panirsirngen do pamnekan da no tao a mapasaway so asa ka nyaneban da tao. 
1234149,"And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. ",No kanang am amyan so asa ka nyaneban da meyngaran so Palapa katenngan da ori no tao a tey marahet so iyangay. 
1234150,"Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? ","Nimalovot o aro a tao. Maniring si Pilato jira am, ""Sino nyo kakzeben a pasawain ko. Si Palapa o pasawain ko an? No si Yeso a ipanci da Misayya o pasawain ko."" "
1234151,For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.,Katenngan ni Pilato o nyahapan da si Yeso a itoro jya do keynanahet da nya.
1234152,"When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. ","Pacicin ni Pilato am manovoy o mavakes na so tao a mangay manci nya jya so kaji na manaptan do abo so kararatan a tao, ta tey manganyahey o tatateynep na. "
1234153,"But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. ",Am kapasozisozi da so aro a tao no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan a manci ni Pilato a mapasaway si Palapa a kawakwak da si Yeso. 
1234154,"The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. ","Maniring si Pilato jira am, ""Sira rana o yararwa eya am sino jira ya o apyapyahen nyo a pasawain ko."" Maniring sira am, ""Si Palapa."" "
1234155,"Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. ","Maniring jira si Pilato am, ""Kongwen ko so wanjin si Yeso a da ipanci no tao a Misayya."" "
1234156,"And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.","Maniring sira o aro a tao am, ""Padketen do jyojika."" Maniring si Pilato am, ""Ikongo na mina vazay a marahet."" Meyratateng am ikeykavevek da amlololos no aro a tao a manci no kapadket sya do jyojika."
1234157,"When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. ","Ileylamdamen na sira ni Pilato am katenngan na rana o kabo na rana no pasapahen na jira ciring, ta ikanyahey na kapeyzavozavoz da no aro a tao. Meyratateng am mangap so ranom a pangain na do tangain no aro a tao a kapavanaw na. Maniring am, ""No si mawakwak ya am cyaha, ta beken a raraten ko, ta monganay jinyo."" "
1234158,"Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.","Karahan am akma sirey asa o tao a manci no, ""No si mawakwak o tao ori am cyaha, ta monganay jyamen a kano sivosivovoong namen o mapeyraraten sya."""
1234159,"Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. ",Meyratateng am pasawain na ni Pilato si Palapa a kapanci na rana no tao a somipsipzot ji Yeso a katoro na rana nya jira a padketen do jyojika.
1234160,"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. ",O imong ni Pilato a itaysang no Loma am yangay da na si Yeso do pantaw no vahay ni Pilato a limoten. 
1234161,"And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.","Meyratateng am opsowen da o ayob ni Yeso a kapayob da jya so akmey ayob no panirsirngen, "
1234162,"And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! ","kapamalikawag da so tazici a pasakopen da jya a kapakemkem da sya do wanan na so vazit a kapeylilitod da do tangain na meykeykaming nya. Maniring sira am, ""Makapintek a Panirsirngen da no tao do Yotay,"" "
1234163,"And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. ",a kacicipa da jya a sipsipzotan no vazit so oo. 
1234164,"And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. ",Teyka da peyyaliliman am opsowen da o nipeyyayob da sya akmey ayob no panirsirngen a kapayob da rana so meyngongyod a ayob na a kangay da rana mapadket sya do jyojika.
1234165,"And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.","Makowbot sira am makasinmo sira so tao do Cidinay a meyngaran so Simong. Karahan am gacigatan da somabway no jyojika ni Yeso, "
1234166,"And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, ",a kangay da nya do meyngaran so Keketa. O peypeypangayan na am Yanga no oo no tao. 
1234167,"they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. ",Meyratateng am mangap sira so nipazavozan da so kosozi a makopad a ranom a ipeyyop da si Yeso. Am mina kataham na jya a ji na niyop. 
1234168,"And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. ",Padketen da rana si Yeso do jyojika am macipangoyongoyot sira amvonong so mina ayob na.
1234169,And sitting down they watched him there; ,Karahan am amlisna sira do dang a omzat jya. 
1234170,"and set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. ","Amyan so nivatvatkan da do kayo a nipayoray da do jyojika a raraten na. O nivatvatkan da ciring am, ""Iya ya am Panirsirngen da no tao do Yotay,"" "
1234171,"Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.",a kapazasing da so rarwa nimanakaw a tao do wanan na kado ozi na a padketen do jyojika.
1234172,"And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, ",O meyhatay jya tao am to da ligaligana o oo da mapasnesnek si Yeso. 
1234173,"and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. ","""Ipanci mo asyo o kakava mo so rako a panaralayan a kapakatlo na araw no ipatnek mo sya. No ka manoyong a Anak ni Ama ta do to am avyay pala o kataotao mo. Peyhekas pala do jyojika."" "
1234174,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, ","O panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan am akman sang sira meykeykaming nya. Maniring sira am, "
1234175,"He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. ","""Na mavyay o karwan no tao a na jyatenngi o kataotao na na avyain. No manoyong a Panirsirngen no Isedi am na ji meyhekasi do jyojika. Ta ori o anoyngan ta jya. "
1234176,"He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. ","Na ipeyhanhan si Ama ta do to. Na ipanci o kataotao na Anak no Tao do to. No komwan am citahen ta pala. Manngwa, ala avyain na ni Ama ta do to an?"" "
1234177,"The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. ",Akman sang sira o yamacitazing jya do jyojika nimanakaw a tao a mapeyleylak sya.
1234178,Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. ,Meyigen o araw am mina todakedep o teyrahem so atlo a ka vatvatek. 
1234179,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? ","Ikatlo na ka vatvatek do makoyab am amlololos si Yeso. Maniring am, ""Idi, Idi, lama sapahetani."" O peypeypangayan na am, ""Mo Ama do to, mo Ama do to, mo peymakarwan jyaken."""
1234180,"Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. ","Maniring sira o makamizing sya tao am, ""Na tawagan si Idiya."" "
1234181,"And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. ",Amyan so asa ka tao a mina to malalayo a mangay mangap so akmey tapaik a katahem na sya do makopad a ranom a kapalibed na sya do anaro a avyao a itoro ji Yeso a ipeyyop na sya. 
1234182,"The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.","Maniring sira o karwan no tao am, ""Nanalahen ta pala. Ala mai si Idiya mahap sya ang."" "
1234183,"Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. ",Ipirwa na kalolos ni Yeso am mazavat o inawan na.
1234184,"And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; ",No kanang am o bengbeng no rako a panaralayan a milakayob am mina todapising a kapeykanini na kapeykezi no pongow. 
1234185,"and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, ",So mina to na iwangi no heseb da a mina todavyai rana no amraralay ni Ama ta do to a tao. 
1234186,"and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.",Mirwa mavyay si Yeso am karwan da o heseb da a mangay rana do Yelosaleng. So ikaro no tao a nimakacita sira ang. 
1234187,"Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. ","Macita na no panirsirngen no itaysang no Loma kano kararay na nimamzat ji Yeso o nimeykanini a kano makakaday a vazay am manyahey sira. Maniring sira am, ""Yamanoyong ya Anak no Tao do to."""
1234188,"And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: ",Amyan dang so aro a mavakes a makacita sya a macyatovang jya. Sira rana am apo sira do Cyadidi a nimacihza ji Yeso a mapeyveyveken sya. 
1234189,"among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.",O amyan do dang am Matelyan Madiya kano asa ka Madiya a ina da Yake a kani Yoseyvo a kano mavakes ni Sipitay.
1234190,"When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimath&#230; a, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: ",Maseyrem rana am amyan so meynakem a tao a nimapo do Adimatay a meyngaran so Yoseyvo. Iya rana am nimacinanao ori ji Yeso. 
1234191,"he went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. ","So nyangay na ji Pilato a manci no kakas na so kataotao ni Yeso. Karahan am manovoy si Pilato so lamlamsoy na a manci no kapya na mangay da hapen no kataotao ni Yeso, "
1234192,"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, ","a kahap na rana sya ni Yoseyvo a kapongos na jya no malavang a milakayob, "
1234193,"and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. ","a mey pakakasahen do nidokdokan da rako a mao a akmey azcip. Ori rana am vayo pa ori a nidokdokan na, a kalolog na so rako a vato a pazevngen na do ngoso na a kangay na rana. "
1234194,"And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.",Si Matelyan Madiya kano asa ka tao a meyngaran si Madiya am amhezsad sira do katovangan no ngoso no heseb ni Yeso.
1234195,"Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, ",Ikadwa na araw am araraw no ipeywalam no tao do Yotay. O panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano tao a macyagom do Vadisay am mangay sira ji Pilato. 
1234196,"saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. ","Maniring sira am, ""Mo maran, namen pa manakem o ciring no yamangalalas a tao no kavyay na pa manci no, 'Ikatlo na araw am mavyay ko pa.' "
1234197,"Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. ","Am ori o pancyan mo no tao a makapzat do heseb na so katlo araw a kaji da makatakawan so kataotao na no macinanao jya, ta todey mancyan do tao o kanimirwa na mavyay.

1234198,"Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. ","Maniring jira si Pilato am, ""Palolo kamo so mamzamzat a itaysang kapakapya nyo a mamzat do heseb na."" "
1234199,"So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.",Karahan am pangayan da so itovil da jya do vato a somengseng do ngoso no heseb na a kato da rana vezedan do dang no itaysang a mamzat do heseb na.
1234200,"In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. ",Madagdag do niciyo do nikavitos no ipeywalam no tao am meyheza sira Matelyan Madiya kano asa ka tao a meyngaran si Madiya mangay do heseb ni Yeso a mangay tomita sya. 
1234201,"And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. ","Makarahan am to meykanini a kapeygegcin no tinsi ni Ama ta do to a apo do teyngato a kalolog na no rako a vato a nipasengseng da do heseb na, kalisna na jya. "
1234202,"His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: ",O kataotao na am to maniray. O talili na am akma raney otab no awa so kalavalavang. 
1234203,"and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. ",Pandan da rana amzikzik a manyahey no mamzat do heseb na tao. So nikazyazikaz da do teyrahem a akmey nimawakwak a tao. 
1234204,"And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. ","Maniring o tinsi do mavavakes am, ""Ji kamo anyahey. Ko katenngan inyo a yakomala si Yeso a nipadket da do jyojika. "
1234205,"He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. ","Yarana ji ngyan do jya, ta na nipangononongan o ciring na a yanimirwa rana yamavyay. Sijya kamo a kacita nyo so yada nipangayan sya, "
1234206,"And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.

1234207,And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.,Karahan am meybebezbezan sira komaro rana do heseb na ang. No mangay kasaray da am mangay kanyahey da a malalayo a mangay do macinanao jya. 
1234208,"And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. ","Meyratateng am to da cita si Yeso do rarahan. Maniring jira am, ""Kokay kamo."" Am ori o nipeypanam da mangay a omyapet so ai na amraralay nya. "
1234209,"Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.","Maniring jira si Yeso am, ""Ji kamo anyahey. Angay kamo na kapanci nyo nya do karwan nyo a mangay do Cyadidi. Cyaha, ta macita da yaken do dang."""
1234210,"Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.

1234224,"And there went out unto him all the land of Jud&#230; a, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.

1234225,"And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; ",Meyyayob si Yowani so niparing da a bobow no baka a kapeyyabtek na so kolit no baka a kakan na so zozon a kano maganinem a amyan do vahay no tapipi.

1234228,"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. ",Makarahan am mai si Yeso a apo do Nasale a ili a macinapnap do Cyadidi kataktak na ji Yeso ni Yowani do ayo a meyngaran so Yotan. 
1234229,"And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: ",Meypapowpow si Yeso a apo do ranom am macita na o hanit a kacyangan. Makarahan am mangay maneyked jya o akmey hato rana Seyzi.

1234233,"Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, ",Aneban da si Yowani am mangay si Yeso do Cyadidi a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1234234,"and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.","Maniring am, ""Yarana makeykai o yana katalamozong ninyo ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o karwan nyo na do peyraratenan nyo a omanoyong do Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to."""
1234235,"Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. ",Mangonong si Yeso do pasalan no rako a meybebneng a ranom a ngaranan da Cyadidi am macita na o rarwa ka tao a mangahangahahap a meyngaran so Simong a kano kakteh na meyngaran so Antele a amzoyo no tawaz da.

1234237,"And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. ",Mamizing da am to da rana ngaroi o tawaz da macilolo ji Yeso.
1234238,"And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. ",Alikey pa o nyalaman na am macita na ni Yeso o anak na ni Sipitay a meyngaran so Yake a kano kakteh na si Yowani a rarwa a tomonod so nyayoma da tawaz do tatala da.

1234240,"And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. ",Makaranes sira do ili do Cyapaynong am amyan si Yeso do peyneynozyan a mangnanao so tao do ipeywalam no tao. 
1234241,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. ","Isavasavak da no makamizing so ciring na ni Yeso o ipangnanao na.

1234242,"And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, ",No kanang am amyan so kovotan no kalamsoyan ni Satan a tao a mai do peyneynozyan.

1234245,"And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. ",Makarahan am mina to na pazikzika o tao ang no komovot jya a kalololos na kapakowbot na rana do tao ang. 
1234246,"And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. ","Isavasavak da no aro a tao. Am ori o nipeysingsingkad da manci no, ""Asyo o akman sya vazay. Abo pa o akman sya nimamizing ta a nanao.

1234247,And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.,Ori o nipeyrengarengayan da rana do ngaran ni Yeso do Cyadidi.
1234248,"And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. ",Karwan na o peyneynozyan ni Yeso am mangay do vahay da Simong a kani Antele. Macita ni Yake a kani Yowani am macihza sira mangay. 
1234249,"But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. ","Ikongo do paingwaten na o icyarwa na mavakes ni Simong, am ori o to na ngirai. Makaranes si Yeso am ipanci da ji Yeso o ingingnen no mavakes ang. "
1234250,"And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.",Ori o nyangay na tomita sya ni Yeso. Makarahan am pinanan na o lima na keyvangon na sya. Am ji na rana nipaingwat. Am ori o nipeyvangon na rana tomaotao sira.

1234252,And all the city was gathered together at the door. ,So nikalovot no tao do ili a nimai. Ori o nipanicit da no aro a tao do pangengneban. 
1234253,"And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.","Makarahan am iwakwakan na rana sira o meykeyngeyngen a tao ni Yeso a kapya da rana.

1234254,"And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. ",Ji pazngang do ikadwa na araw am mayokay si Yeso a kangay na do kabwan no tao a meynozi. 
1234255,And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. ,O meyngaran so Simong a kano kararay na am kalahen da si Yeso. 
1234256,"And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.","Makala da am maniring sira am, ""Abo yaji ngala jimo."" "
1234257,"And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Mangay tamo do teyhesa ka ili, ta ipeylimwang ko do dang o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to, ta ori o ko nyai do karawan."" "
1234258,"And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.",Makarahan am nikakaday ni Yeso o peyneynozyan do Cyadidi a peylimwangan no ciring na ni Ama ta do to a kavozwaw na so komovot do tao a kalamsoyan ni Satan.
1234259,"And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. ","Amyan so asa ka tao a omlabyab so kataotao a mangay do tangain ni Yeso a meylilitod a mapasyasi jya. Maniring am, ""No si apyahen mo am jyabo kaji na apyan no kataotao ko a."" "
1234260,"And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.","Ikarilaw na ni Yeso. Am ori o niparapongan na so lima na jya. Maniring am, ""Ko apyahen. So na rana ikapya no kataotao mo."" "
1234261,"And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. ",Ji nimeyyahahay o kataotao na mapya. 
1234262,"And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; ","So nitovoyan na rana sya ni Yeso. O nipakoyokoy na pa jya am, "
1234263,"and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.","""Ji mo meylimwangan do tao an.

1234264,"But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.",Am makowbot o tao ori am to na rana meylimwangan do aro a tao. Am ori o ji na rana nimangai do ili ni Yeso. So niseysan na do siri no ili da. Ta jyates sira o aro a tao do peycyeylilyan na mangay komala sya.
1234265,And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house. ,"Makanateng do araraw am meysinaoli si Yeso a mangay do Cyapaynong. Katenngan da no aro a tao o keyyan na do asa ka vahay am, "
1234266,"And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them. ","meysilisilin sira o aro a tao a mangay ji Yeso. So nikabo rana no yanan da do vahay ang. Akman sang do ngoso no vahay. Ta manicit o tao. Mangononong si Yeso do aro a tao am, "
1234267,"And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. ",amyan so papat a ka tao a mangai so asa ka tao a ji makapeyvangon. 
1234268,"And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. ","Ikongo do tey yaro o tao, am ori o ji da makaslislini a mangay nya do tangain ni Yeso, kato da rana ngalatan do atep no ji makapeyvangon a tao a kakabkab da so atep no vahay a katonton da so tao a mangay pazomtaden do yanan ni Yeso.

1234269,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.","Macita na ni Yeso o kakdekdeng no onowned da am maniring do ji makapeyvangon a tao am, ""Yarana nimavonas, mo keypong, o raraten mo."""
1234270,"But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, ",O amlisna do dang a mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to am ikazyak da. 
1234271,Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? ,"""Asyo ori a jyaninig ni Ama ta do to a yato manci no akman sang a ciring. Si Ama ta do to saon o makavonas so raraten am."" "
1234272,"And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?","Mahaw na ni Yeso o onowned da. Maniring jira am, ""Ikongo nyo ikakman sang so nakenakem. "
1234273,"Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?","Masalisalit o kapanci ko no kavonas na rana no raraten no yameyngen eyto an? No apyapya o kapanci ko no, 'Peyvangon rana kapaciralay mo na do ititkehan mo a mangay rana.' "
1234274,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy, ) ","Ko ipacita jinyo o oyowyat ko a Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao a manvonas so raraten no tao do karawan."" Makarahan am maniring do ji makapeyvangon a tao am, "

1234276,"And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.","So nipeyvangon na rana no tao a omahap so nirayan na a kapakowbot na rana.

1234277,"And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them. ",Ipirwa na kangay ni Yeso do rako a meybebneng a ranom a ngaranan da Cyadidi am aro sira o tao a meylovolovot do tangain na. Am ori o ninanawan na sira.

1234378,And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.,To mapasyasi ji Yeso a manci no kaji na vozwawan sira do dang. 
1234379,Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. ,No kanang am amyan do tokon so aro a kois a meykoskos.

1234381,"And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. ",Makarahan am apyahen na sira ni Yeso. Am ori o nipakowbot da na do kataotao na no tao ang a kangay da komovot do aro a kois.

1234389,"And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea. ",Somakay si Yeso do vazangay am mangay do katovangan no rako a meybebneng a ranom. Makaranes am meylovolovot o aro a tao do tangain na. 
1234390,"And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, ",Amyan do dang so asa ka meymatmatngeh no peyneynozyan a meyngaran so Yalo a nimacizavoz do aro a tao. Macita na si Yeso am mangay meylilitod do tangain ni Yeso a mapasyasi jya. 
1234391,"and besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live. ","Maniring am, ""Yatey makdeng o ingingnen no anak ko a mavakes. Mangay mo pa parapongen o lima mo jya keywakwak mo jya kapya na rana."" "
1234392,"And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.",Makarahan am macihza si Yeso jya mangay. Aro tao a meysilisilin a macihza jya.
1234393,"And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, ",Amyan do dang so asa ka mavakes a makadwa so icyarwa (12) so awawan a to makaliliw so kataotao na gomcin no rala. 
1234394,"and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, ","Nipasowsow na o kangangay na do pangavavawan am ji na apyan no ingingnen na, ta ipeypeyparahet na. "
1234395,"when she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. ",Mamizing na o vazay ni Yeso am ori o nipacislin na do aro a tao a kangay na do likod ni Yeso a minan do talili na. 
1234396,"For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. ","O nakenakem na am, ""No si pinanan ko o ayob na am jya todapya rana o kataotao ko a."" "
1234397,And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. ,Makarahan am mina todapya rana o kataotao na do pakaliliwan na sya. 
1234398,"And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?","Am to na rana tenngi ni Yeso o oyowyat a makowbot do kataotao na. Am ori o nipaolyan na so mata na do aro a tao. Maniring am, ""Sino yaminan do ayob ko ang."" "
1234399,"And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? ","Maniring sira o macinanao jya am, ""Mo panangangayan nya. Mo jyacita o aro a tao a meysilisilin a mangay jimo? Mo kapanahes no niminan jimo."" "
1234400,And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. ,Am ori o nicittan na so sirisiri na. Cittan na so tao a niminan jya. 
1234401,"But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. ",Katenngan na rana no mavakes o kapya na rana no kataotao na am to rana zikzik a manyahey. Am ori o nipeylilitod na do tangain ni Yeso a manci no kaniminan na jya. 
1234402,"And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.","Maniring jya si Yeso am, ""Manganako, ka manoyong a yameyhanhan nyaken. Makapiya ka so onowned a mangay rana, ta yarana apya o ingingnen mo."""
1234403,"While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? ","Ji pa vitos o ciring ni Yeso am mai o tao apo do vahay ni Yalo. Maniring sira ji Yalo am, ""Ji mo na mancyan si Yeso, ta yarana nimawakwak o anak mo."" "
1234404,"As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.","Am ji na ngazidan ni Yeso o ciring da. Maniring rana si Yeso do meymatmatngeh no peyneynozyan am, ""Ji ka nyahey. Anoyngan mo yaken."" "
1234405,"And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. ",Makarahan am palolwen na si Pite a kani Yake a kano kakteh na ni Yake a meyngaran so Yowani a mangay. Am ji na mya ni Yeso o tarek a tao a macihza jya.
1234406,"And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. ",Makaranes sira do vahay no meymatmatngeh no peyneynozyan am macita na sira o aro a tao a meykabakabayo a omlavi jya. 
1234407,"And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.","Somdep si Yeso am maniring jira am, ""Ji kamo lavi, ta yamitkeh. Nimakongo kwan nyo."" "
1234408,"And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. ",Mamizing da o ciring ni Yeso am no mangay o kaming da am mangay o kapeyoyaoya da. Makarahan am powboten na sira ni Yeso o aro a tao. O inyapwan na kano tatlo a macinanao jya o amyan do sahad na. 
1234409,"And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise. ","Makarahan am ahapen na o lima no kanakan. Maniring jya am, ""Tadita komi."" O peypeypangayan na no nang am, ""Ko ipanci imo a meyvangon, manganako."" "
1234410,"And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. ",Makarahan am meyvangon rana o kanakan a kalam na rana. No kano nang am adwa o ikasikarwa na no kakawakawan na no kanakan ang. So nipeyzokaban da no vazay ang no inyapwan na. 
1234411,And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.,"Maniring jira si Yeso am, ""Ji nyo meyvehvehyan do tao o akman sang a vazay,"" kapanci na rana nira a mantan nya so kanen na."
1234412,"And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him. ",Karwan na ni Yeso do dang am meysinaoli a mangay rana do ili da a kapacihza da jya no macinanao jya. 
1234413,"And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? ","Marateng rana o ipeywalam no tao am mangnanao si Yeso do peyneynozyan. Aro tao a somavasavak no nimamizing da ciring ni Yeso. Maniring sira am, ""Do wanjin na nipakamizngan so sang. Sino yamanta nya so teneng na ang. Asyo ori yato makapeyvazay so mapeyzokab a vazay. "
1234414,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. ","Beken a ori o meykeykawaz a tao asyo? Beken a iya o anak ni Madiya asyo? Beken a kaka na ni Yake a kani Yoseyvo a kani Yota kani Simong ori asyo? Da kapeyvahay do jya no wari na mavakes eya am."" Makarahan am ikaoya da na si Yeso. "
1234415,"But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.","Maniring jira si Yeso am, ""O panoyonoywan na ni Ama ta do to so ciring na tao am ikanig da sira no tao do peycyeylilyan na. Am kolalahen da sira no pacikeylyanan da kano pacivahayan da tao."" "
1234416,"And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. ",Am ori o ji na nimapeyvazai so mapeyzokab a vazay do ili da. So nikapereh no tao a niparapongan na so lima na a omiwakwak jira. 
1234417,"And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.","Am ori o nyeyyakan na nira, ta ji sira manganoyong o aro a tao. So ji na nimacimazai do kalivolivon na do peycyeylilyan na mangnanao so tao."
1234418,"And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; ",Nilovot na sira o rarwa so ikakarwan a macinanao jya kateyrararwa da tovoin a kapanta na nira so oyowyat da ipamozwaw da so kalamsoyan ni Satan a komovot do tao. 
1234419,"and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse: ","Maniring jira am, ""No mangay kamo am sisikod nyo o palolwen nyo. Ji kamo mapalolo so kanen nyo am nizpi nyo. Ji kamo meyyaomas. "
1234420,but be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats. ,"Apya o kapeytokap nyo. Ji nyo peytapila o ayob nyo."" "
1234421,"And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.","Maniring pa jira am, ""No makaranes kamo do asa ka ili am no masaray o tao a tomaotao jinyo am to kamo na ngisan do vahay da. No mangay kamo rana am ori o karwan nyo jira. "
1234422,"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.","No mangay kamo do vahay da a kaji da raralayan ninyo a taotawwen a ji da ngamiznga so ciring am to nyo na ngaroi sira katoktok nyo so domket do ai nyo a tana, ta tovilan nyo jira meyraraten a tao a ji mamlis so nakenakem."" "
1234423,"And they went out, and preached that men should repent. ",Makarahan am mangay rana sira o macinanao ji Yeso a meylimwang no ciring na ni Ama ta do to a kavavaga da do aro a tao a mamlis rana komaro do peyraratenan da. 
1234424,"And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.",Aro o nivozwaw da a kalamsoyan ni Satan a komovot do tao a kakoris da no haneng do meyngen a tao. So nikaro no niwakwakan da meyngen a tao.
1234425,"And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. ","Mamizing no panirsirngen a meyngaran so Helote o aro a vazay ni Yeso a meylimwang rana do peycyeylilyan na. Maniring sira o tao am, ""Iya o nimanaktak a meyngaran so Yowani a yanimirwa mavyay. Am ori o na ikatey mowyat a yamapeyvazay so mapeyzokab a vazay."" "
1234426,"Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. ","Maniring pa sira o tao am, ""Iya rana am si Idiya."" So iyan no tao a manci nya akmey tao no kakwa a panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to. "
1234427,"But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead. ","Mamizing na o ciring ori no panirsirngen a meyngaran so Helote am maniring am, ""Iya asyo o nimanaktak a si Yowani a nipotowan ko so oo a yarana nimirwa mavyay."""
1234428,"For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her. For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. ",O cinawakwak na ni Yowani am o panirsirngen a meyngaran so Helote am to ney mehsa o mavakes no kakteh na a meyngaran so Veydipo. O ngaran no mavakes am si Helotiya.

1234429,"Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not: ","Si Helotiya rana am to na peyyana do onowned na o oyyan na ni Yowani. Am ori o naknakman na so kawakwak na sya. Am ji na pakongo, "
1234430,"for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.",ta ikanig na ni Helote si Yowani. Ta abo karatan na. Am ori o ji na gogaji nya. Ta ikakza na amizngen o ipangnanao ni Yowani. Am mangday no amizngen na o ipangnanao ni Yowani o kaji nangnedan so ninyakan.
1234431,"And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee; ",Marateng o araraw no cinatazak na tao ni Helote am naknakmen na rana ni Helotiya o kalita na ji Yowani. Makarahan am manaotao si Helote so aro a meynakem a tao a kapazagom na so panipanirsirngen da no tao do Cyadidi. 
1234432,"and when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. ","Makarahan am ipanci na ni Helotiya o anak na mavakes a maganam. Ikakza ni Helote a kano tao na o ganam na. Maniring si Helote do maganam a mavakes am, ""No si amyan so amin mo jyaken am cyaha, ta itoro ko jimo."" "
1234433,"And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. ","Maniring pa am, ""Tana amin mo jyaken o kakteb no pongso ta ya am jyabo kaji ko norwan nya jimo a."" "
1234434,"And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. ","Makarahan am mangay na ahesen o ina na no mavakes ang. Maniring ji ina na am, ""Ikongo amin ko."" Maniring o ina na am, ""Oo no nimanaktak a si Yowani."" "
1234435,"And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. ","Meysinaoli o mavakes do panirsirngen a si Helote a manci nya jya. Maniring am, ""Ji mo peyyahahaya o oo no nimanaktak a si Yowani a pangain do kakanan a itoro jyaken."""
1234436,"And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. ","Mamizing na o ciring na no panirsirngen am ikeyngen na no oo. Am ji na rana pakongo, ta nimamizing da rana no aro a tao o ipanma na ciring. Am ori o ji na makapeyolii so nakem na do mavakes ang. "
1234437,"And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, ","Makarahan am ipanci na rana o lamlamsoy na mangay do pamemtengan a kapotow na ji Yowani, "
1234438,"and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. ",kapangay na so oo na do kakanan a yangay do anak ni Helotiya a mavakes kangay na rana ji ina na. 
1234439,"And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.",Mamizing no macinanao ji Yowani o vazay da am mangay da pingsanan o kataotao na ni Yowani a kangay da rana mapakakasa sya.
1234440,"And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. ",Meysinaoli sira ji Yeso o nipamnekan na a omlivolivon no ciriciring na am ipanci da rana ji Yeso o mina vazay da no kapeylimwang da no ciriciring na. 
1234441,"And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. ","Ikongo do tey yaro o tao, am ori o ikabo no ipeywalam da koman. Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Sijya kamo a kangay tamo meywalam do kabwan no tao."" "
1234442,And they departed into a desert place by ship privately. ,Makarahan am zomagpit sira do vazangay a kangay da rana do kabwan no tao. 
1234443,"And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him. ",Am macita da sira no aro a tao am to da rana tenngi o angayan da. Am ori o nipanmanma da rana no aro a tao do peycyeylilyan a mangay do angayan ni Yeso a kano macinanao jya. 
1234444,"And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.",Makaranes si Yeso do pamsan na am macita na o aro a tao akmey kagling a abo so omonong nira. Am ori o nikasyan na nira. Makarahan am nanawen na sira no aro a ciring.
1234445,"And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed: ","Maseyrem rana am mai sira o macinanao jya. Maniring sira ji Yeso am, ""Yatey mahep rana. Yabo pa do jya o panazangan. "
1234446,"send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat. ","To ta rana mancyan sira meysyasyay a kangay da do ili a mangay manazang so kanen da."" "
1234447,"He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat? ","Maniring jira si Yeso am, ""Pantan kamo sira so kanen da."" Maniring sira o macinanao jya am, ""Manngwa, ipanta mo yamen saon so meycyalaklaksa a nizpi a ipangap namen so kanen da myanpaw?"""
1234448,"He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. ","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Angay pala cita yapira o yada nipalolo a myanpaw."" Citahen da am alima ka myanpaw a kano yadwa ka among. "
1234449,And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass. ,"Makarahan am ipanci na rana ni Yeso o macinanao jya mapeykapyapinpin sira do katamtamkan, "
1234450,"And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. ",kalisna da rana no aro a tao. So niyan dang no kakapowan (100) a tao do asa ka lipenpenan. Amyan so kakaliman (50) do asa ka lipenpenan. 
1234451,"And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all. ","Todahen na ni Yeso o alima ka myanpaw a kano adwa ka among am tangarahen na rana o hanit a kasaray na rana nya ji Ama ta do to, a kakcikcil na rana so myanpaw a itoro do macinanao jya.

1234452,"And they did all eat, and were filled. ",So nikamimin da rana nikoman a mabsoy. 
1234453,"And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes. ",Peykakasahen da na no macinanao jya o atda da myanpaw a kano among am adwa pa o ikarwa na ka yala no nimapanpan. 
1234454,And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.,Vilangan da o mahakay a nikoman am kakaliman a ranaw (5000) sira.
1234455,"And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. ",Mavitos o vazay na am to na rana panma ni Yeso o macinanao jya a somakay do vazangay a mangay do Peysayta a ili. Ta tovoin na pa sira o aro a tao a mangay rana. 
1234456,"And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray. ",Teyka na taitaiden o aro a tao ni Yeso am omangaz do tokon a meynozi. 
1234457,"And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. ",Mahep rana am makanavak o vazangay do rako a meybebneng a ranom am maveyvow pa si Yeso do tokon a meynozi. 
1234458,"And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them. ",Macita na o macinanao jya mazikna komaod so vazangay a somangoz so yanan da ranom. Toda jyaraw am mangonong si Yeso do ranom a mangay do macinanao jya. 
1234459,"But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out: ",Macita da no macinanao jya si Yeso a omalam do ranom am ipanci da anito. Am ori o nilololos da a manyahey. 
1234460,"for they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.","So nikamimin da nimanyahey a makacita sya. Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Ji kamo anyahey, ta yaken."" "
1234461,"And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered. ",Makarahan am zomagpit rana do vazangay kapacioran na rana jira. Makarahan am mahanang rana. Am ori o nisavasavakan da nya no macinanao jya. 
1234462,For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.,"Ta tana nimacita da rana o kaniomabsoy na so aro a tao am ji da pa tenngi o ka Tao do to na ni Yeso, do kaji da makazaban sya no onowned."
1234463,"And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore. ",Makarahan am makaranes rana sira do Kenisale. 
1234464,"And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him, ",Meyhekas sira do vazangay am katovilan da rana si Yeso no aro a tao. 
1234465,"and ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. ",Mamizing da si Yeso amyan dang am ori o nipeypalapalalayo da a mangay a mahap so meykeyngeyngen a tao do itkehan da a mangay nira do yanan ni Yeso. 
1234466,"And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.",Tana mangay si Yeso do likta ili a tana mangay do rako a ili am mamimin o meykeyngeyngen a tao a peypangain da do rararahan.

1234467,"Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. ",O tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano nimapo do Yelosaleng a mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to am mangay sira do tangain ni Yeso. 
1234468,"And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. ",Macita da o macinanao ji Yeso a todangan a ji nimavanaw a ji nginara so tao a macyagom do Vadisay a mavanaw. 
1234469,"For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. ",Ta sira rana o tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano tao do Yotay am to da vangovangona o icicirawat da no ineynapo da. O icicirawat no ineynapo da am no ji mavanaw am jyangan. 
1234470,"And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.",O nisazangan a kanekanen am no ji ngoyasi am ji da nganna. So ikaro na pa dang no iwawalam da vangovangonen da do kowyas da do ininoman da kano kama da kano makakaday a kakakanan da.
1234471,"Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? ","Am ori o pacicyan da si Yeso no tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano mangnanao so iwawalam ni Ama ta do to. Maniring sira am, ""Ikongo da ji ngapi no macinanao jimo so icicirawat no ineynapo ta a yatodangan a yajya nimavanaw."" "
1234472,"He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""O ciring na ni Isayya jinyo a yatanwasiwasi am manoyong saon am.

1234493,"But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""Panmanmahen o kabsoy so anak, ta malas o kawasik no kanen no anak do ino."" "
1234494,"And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. ","Maniring o mavakes am, ""Manoyong ori mo Panirsirngen. Am o meycyakakas a kanen no anak am kanen ori no ino."" "

1234508,"And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. ","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Yapira myanpaw o yamyan jinyo."" Maniring sira am, ""Yapito a ka myanpaw."" "
1234509,"And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.

1234514,"And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. ",Amyan so tao a macyagom do Vadisay a nimangay ji Yeso a macinekad jya.

1234654,"And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.","Makaranes si Yeso do Yelosaleng am mangay do rako a panaralayan a tomita so makakaday a amyan do dang.

1234656,"and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet. ",Macita na do anamen da angayan o meyngaran so ovako a kayo a mapka no voong na. Mangay do kayo a meykala so asi na am voong na o macita na. Ta beken pa vehavehan no ipalasi na.

1234658,"And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; ",Makaranes sira do Yelosaleng am mangay si Yeso do rako a panaralayan a mapowbot so manazang no makakaday a apzapzatan da a kapasakeb na sya ibokbok so peypalipalitan da so nizpi a kavangan a kano lilisnan da no manazang no hato a tao.

1234661,"And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.

1234662,"And when even was come, he went out of the city.",Maseyrem rana am karwan da o ili ang ni Yeso a kano macinanao jya.

1234670,"And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, ",Mirwa sira mangay do Yelosaleng.

1234677,"And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.","Nanawen na sira ni Yeso am mangononong so pehngehngayan na so ciring na.

1234683,"But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.","Meysirisiring rana sira o nimvood so hakawan na tao am maniring rana sira am, 'Iya ya o yaomamoon so nihakawan na. To ta na wakwaka kamoon ta so nihakawan na.' "

1234690,"And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to C&#230; sar, or not?

1234693,"And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to C&#230; sar the things that are C&#230; sar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""No komwan am o monganay ji Kaysa am itoro nyo jya. Akman sang ta o monganay ji Ama ta do to am itoro nyo ji Ama ta do to.""

1234694,"Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, ",O tao a macyagom do Satokay a ji nganoyong do kavyay pa no nimawakwak a tao am mangay sira ji Yeso. 
1234695,"Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. ","Maniring sira am, ""Mo Mangnanao, o nanao ni Moyse am no mawakwak o tao a kabo no anak na am pasakain no kakteh na o mavakes na a keyyan no komownongan no kakteh na rakeh do karawan. "
1234696,"Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. ",No kakwa am amyan so papito a meyketeketeh. Mapapapen o rakeh jira am abo taodtod na no kawakwak na. 
1234697,"And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. ","Karahan am papenen no tomonton jira. Mawakwak ori am akman sang a abo so taodtod. O ikatlo da am akman sang, "
1234698,"And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. ",a kato da twatontonan a meyketeketeh a mapapapen so mina mavakes no rakeh jira. Am abo taodtod da. Mownay am mawakwak rana o mavakes ang. 
1234699,"In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. ","Manngwa, no marateng o araraw no ikeypirwa mavyay no tao am sino jira ang o manoyong a mapeykahanghangan so sang. Ta nimamimin sira o papito a meyketeketeh ori a nimapasakay sya."""
1234700,"And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Kamo tey malas an. Ta nyo jyatenngi o Seysyo. Nyo jyatenngi o oyowyat ni Ama ta do to. "
1234701,"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.",No si mirwa a mavyay o tao a apo do heseb da am akman sira so tinsi do teyngato a ji macivahavahay. 
1234702,"And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?","O vazay rana ano mirwa a mavyay o nimawakwak a tao am manngwa, nyo jya nivilangan o vakong ni Moyse do jyasleb a kayo?

1234703,"He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.","O peypeypangayan no nang am Tao do to da si Ama ta do to no mavyay a tao a omanoyong jya.

1234704,"And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? ","Mamizing na no asa ka mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a tao o ciring da am isaray na o nitovis ni Yeso do tao a macyagom do Satokay. Am ori o nyangay na mapacici si Yeso. Maniring am, ""Ikongo ney makdeng na do nanao ni Ama ta do to."" "
1234705,"And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is , Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:","Maniring si Yeso am, ""O ney makdeng na am, 'Inyo rana Isedi a tao am amizngen nyo. O Panirsirngen ta Tao do to ta am yabo ikararwa na a Panirsirngen ta. "
1234706,"and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.",O onowned mo a kano pahad mo a kano nakenakem mo a kano oyowyat mo am to mo peykasa a omraralay ni Ama ta do to a Tao do to mo.'
1234707,"And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.","Ikadwa na am, 'Ikarilaw mo o icyatatao mo. So to mo peyyangai so aryarilaw mo so kataotao mo a marilaw no icyatatao mo.' So ikabo na rana no makataha so sya so kakdekdeng."""
1234708,"And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: ","Maniring ji Yeso o mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a tao am, ""Mo Mangnanao, yabo mo kalasan. So na ikanoyong no ciring mo, do yana kasa ka tao ni Ama ta do to a yabo so ikararwa. "
1234709,"and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. ","So raralayan ta ni Ama ta do to no onowned ta kano nakenakem ta kano oyowyat ta, a kato peyyangayan so aryarilaw so kataotao a marilaw no icyatatao. So ikakdekdeng no nya kano nakem ta sya vinyay a kano makakaday a patanangen ji Ama ta do to."" "
1234710,"And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.","Meylamdam na ni Yeso o tao ori a mateneng a mapasapa jya am maniring jya si Yeso am, ""Ka na makeykai a macikaop do italamozong na ni Ama ta do to.""

Maniring am, ""Ikongo da pancyan no mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to so kapeysivovoong na so Misayya ni Tawey. "

1234823,"And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest: ",Amyan pa si Pite do pantaw no vahay no panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am amyan so lamlamsoy da a mavakes a mai. 
1234824,"and when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. ","Macita na si Pite a manangdang am to na ningkaji. Maniring ji Pite am, ""Imo asyo o kararay na no tao do Nasale a si Yeso?"" "
1234825,"But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew. ","Maniring si Pite am, ""Ko jyasingkaji o yamo ipanci a tao ang."" Teyka na o ciring na am meyparai jira. "
1234826,"And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them. ","Makarahan am macita na pa si Pite no mavakes ang. Maniring do meytatanek do katangked da tao am, ""Iya rana ito am yamacinanao jya ori."" "
1234827,"And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galil&#230; an, and thy speech agreeth thereto. ","Mamizing ni Pite am alalasan na. Makarahan am o meytatanek do siri da tao am maniring sira ji Pite am, ""Ji mo naywa o mo kapacikaop jira. Ta imo rana am tao ka do Cyadidi."" "
1234828,"But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. ","Maniring si Pite am, ""Tana to ko mangavay am ko jyatenngi o tao a nyo ipanci ang. No yamalas o ciring ko am cyaha, ta yamyan si Ama ta do to a mapasingesinget jyaken."" "
1234829,"And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.",Teyka na ori a ciring am ipirwa na so katazokokok no manok. Karahan am manakem na rana ni Pite o mina ciring ni Yeso do keypitlo na omalalas jya no keypidwa na tomazokokok o manok. Ji na pariparing o onowned na am to rana zezezeng a omlavi.
1234830,"And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. ",Apnezak do ikadwa na araw am meykaygi rana sira o panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan a kano mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a kano aro a panipanirsirngen. Karahan am pamnekan da na o vazay da. Meyratateng am vaoden da na si Yeso a yangay ji Pilato. 
1234831,"And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it .","Maniring si Pilato jya am, ""Panirsirngen da imo no tao do Yotay?"" Maniring si Yeso am, ""Noon, manoyong ori."" "
1234832,And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. ,So nikaro no marahet a vazay a iraherahet da si Yeso no panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to. 
1234833,"And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. ","Am ori o nipacicyan na pa si Yeso ni Pilato. Maniring am, ""Amizing pala o aro a vazay a da iraherahet jimo. Manngwa, yabo ciring mo a yamo ipasapa jira?"" "
1234834,But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.,Akman sang ta abo o asa ka ciring a nipasapa na jira ni Yeso. Am ori o savasavakan na nya ni Pilato.
1234835,"Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. ",Mangday no mamaring sira so kanen do Iyeci o kato na mangozayan jya ni Pilato do kapamnekan da no tao a mapasaway so asa ka tao a nipteng da. 
1234836,"And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. ",Nimacinao o meyngaran so Palapa a macizavoz do aptengen da. Iya rana ori am mapasobsobna do seyvo a kapanwakwak na so tao. 
1234837,And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. ,Malovot sira o aro a tao a manci ni Pilato so kapasaway na so asa ka tao. 
1234838,"But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? ","Maniring si Pilato jira am, ""Manngo kamo a apyapya kapasaway ko so panirsirngen nyo a tao do Yotay an?"" "
1234839,For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. ,Am katenngan na rana ni Pilato o nyahapan da si Yeso a itoro jya no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to do keynanahet da nya. Am ori o nyangayan da nya jya. 
1234840,"But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. ",Am kapasozisozi da so aro a tao no panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a manci ni Pilato a mapasaway si Palapa. 
1234841,"And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? ","Ipidwa na pacicin sira o aro a tao ni Pilato am maniring jira am, ""Kongwen ko so wanjin o nyo ipanci a panirsirngen nyo a tao do Yotay ang."" "
1234842,"And they cried out again, Crucify him. ","Maniring sira o aro a tao a amlololos am, ""Padketen do jyojika!"" "
1234843,"Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.","Maniring si Pilato am, ""Ikongo na mina vazay a yamarahet."" Ikeykavevek da amlololos no aro a tao. Maniring sira am, ""Padketen do jyojika!"" "
1234844,"And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. ",Ji na pasovoy o aro a tao ni Pilato am to na rana norwan jira si Palapa a kapanci na rana no tao a somipsipzot ji Yeso a katoro na rana ni Yeso jira yangay da padketen do jyojika.
1234845,"And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Pr&#230; torium; and they call together the whole band. ",Karahan am yangay da no itaysang no Loma si Yeso do tezantehed no vahay ni Pilato a kapeylovolovot da na so aro a itaysang. 
1234846,"And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, ","Meyratateng am payoben da si Yeso so akmey ayob no panirsirngen a kapamalikawag da so akmey tazici a pasakopen da jya, "
1234847,"and began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! ","a kalogologod da nya. Maniring sira am, ""Makapintek ka Panirsirngen no tao do Yotay an."" "
1234848,"And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. ",Karahan am bakbakan da no vazit o oo na a kacicipa da jya a kapeylilitod da amlogologod nya. 
1234849,"And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.",Teyka da peyyaliliman am opsowen da na o nipeyyayob da sya akmey ayob no panirsirngen a kapayob da na jya so meyngongyod a ayob na a kangay da rana nya padketen do jyojika.
1234850,"And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.",Makanavak do rarahan na am masinmo da o asa ka tao a meyngaran si Simong a omoli a apo do takey. Masinmo da ori am pahanhanen da ori a somabway no jyojika ni Yeso. (Si Simong rana am tao do Cidinay a inyapwan da ni Yadisanta kani Lovo.) 
1234851,"And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. ",Yangay da si Yeso do meyngaran so Keketa. O peypeypangayan no nang am Yanga no oo no tao. 
1234852,And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. ,Amyan sira do dang am peyyopen da si Yeso so nipazavozan da so kosozi a makopad a ranom. Am ji na ngyopa ni Yeso. 
1234853,"And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. ",Padketen da rana si Yeso do jyojika am macipangoyongoyot sira amvonong so mina ayob na. 
1234854,"And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. ",Ikasyam no vatvatek do apnezak am padketen da si Yeso do jyojika. 
1234855,"And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. ","O nivatvatkan da raraten na am, ""Iya ya am Panirsirngen da no tao do Yotay,"" "
1234856,"And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. ",a kapazanod da so rarwa nimanakaw a tao ji Yeso a padketen do jyojika. Asa am pain da do wanan na. O asa am pain da do ozi na. 
1234857,"And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.","[So na nipangononong rana no akman sang a ciring do Seysyo. Ta o domket dang am, ""Nipazasing da do meyraraten a tao.""]"
1234858,"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, ","O meyhatay do dang a tao am to da ligaligana o oo da mapasnesnek si Yeso. Maniring sira am, ""Ka jyapya yamanci no kakavakava mo so rako a panaralayan a kapakatlo na araw no ipatnek mo sya. "
1234859,"save thyself, and come down from the cross. ","Peyhekas do jyojika sicyaikwaya kavyay mo so kataotao mo am."" "
1234860,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. ","Akman sang sira o panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a meykeykaming nya. Maniring sira am, ""Na mavyay o karwan no tao a na jyatenngi o kataotao na avyain. "
1234861,"Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.","Kizisto a Panirsirngen no Isedi, peyhekas pala do jyojika, ta citahen namen, ta ori o anoyngan namen jimo."" Akman sang sira o kararay na nipadket da do jyojika mapeyleylak sya."
1234862,"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. ",Meyigen o araw am mina todakedep o teyrahem so atlo a ka vatvatek. 
1234863,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? ","Ikatlo na ka vatvatek do makoyab am amlololos si Yeso. Maniring am, ""Idi, Idi, lama sapahetani."" O peypeypangayan na am, ""Mo Ama do to, mo Ama do to, mo peymakarwan jyaken."""
1234864,"And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. ","Mamizing da no tao am maniring sira am, ""Na tawagan si Idiya."" "
1234865,"And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. ","Amyan so asa ka tao a mangay omahap so nitahem do makopad a ranom a akmey tapaik a palibden do anaro a avyao a itoro ji Yeso ipeyyop na sya. Maniring am, ""Nanalahen ta pala ang, ta ala mai si Idiya mangay mapakas sya do jyojika an."""
1234866,"And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. ",Ipisa kalolos na ni Yeso am mazavat o inawan na. 
1234867,And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.,O bengbeng no rako a panaralayan a milakayob am mina todapising. 
1234868,"And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. ","O amyan do tangain no jyojika a panirsirngen no itaysang no Loma am macita na si Yeso a amlololos a mawakwak am maniring am, ""Manoyong o tao eya Anak no Tao do to."""
1234869,"There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; ",Amyan so aro a mavakes a makacita sya a macyatovang jya. Sira rana am Matelyan Madiya kano ina na ni Yake a kani Yoseyvo a Madiya kani Salomey a kano karwan da icyamavavakes da. 
1234870,"(who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.",No keyyan ni Yeso do Cyadidi am sira ori o nimacilolo jya a mapeyveyveken sya. Amyan pa sira so aro a mavavakes a nimacihza jya do Yelosaleng.
1234871,"And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, Joseph of Arimath&#230; a, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. ",Maseyrem rana do vekhas na no ipeywalam da no tao do Yotay am nimai si Yoseyvo. Iya rana am tao do Adimatay a tey kanig da ori no panipanirsirngen a kararay na.

1234872,"And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. ","Nisavasavak na ni Pilato o mina kapakamizing na rana si Yeso a nimawakwak. Am ori o nipancyan na no asa ka panirsirngen no itaysang no Loma a mai. Maniring jya am, ""Manngwa, yarana nimawakwak si Yeso?"" "
1234873,"And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. ",Mamizing na do panirsirngen da no itaysang no Loma o kanimawakwak na rana ni Yeso am ori o nipyan na si Yoseyvo a mahap rana so kataotao na ni Yeso. 
1234874,"And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. ",Karahan am manazang si Yoseyvo so milakayob a kangay na rana omkas so kataotao ni Yeso a pongosan no milakayob a mangay pakakasahen do nidokdokan na rana mao a kalolog na so rako a veysen a pazevngen na do heseb na. 
1234875,And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.,Si Matelyan Madiya kano ina na ni Yoseyvo a Madiya am nimacilolo sira. So pakatenngan da do nipakakasan da si Yeso.
1234876,"And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. ","Komavos o ipeywalam no tao am manazang si Matelyan Madiya kani Madiya a ina na ni Yake a kani Salomey so mahangno a haneng, mangay da ikoris do kataotao ni Yeso. "
1234877,"And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. ",Apnezak do niciyo do ipeyzengazengang na rana am mangay sira do nipayan da so kataotao ni Yeso. 
1234878,"And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? ",Amyan sira do rarahan am naknakmen da o kabo no tao a somidong sira a mapeylis so rako a veysen a nipaneb da. 
1234879,"And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. ",Am citahen da am nimalolog rana o rako a vato. 
1234880,"And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. ",Somdep sira do heseb na am macita da o mowva tao a omlisna do kawanan no nipayan da si Yeso a meyyayob so malavang a ayob. Ori o niogto da. 
1234881,"And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. ","Maniring o mowva tao ori am, ""Ji kamo ogto a mavokahaw. Ta ko katenngan inyo a yakomala so yada nipadket do jyojika tao do Nasale a si Yeso. Am yana ji ngyan do jya, ta yarana nimirwa mavyay.

1234882,"But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. ","a kangay nyo na manci nya do macinanao jya.

1234883,"And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.",No mangay kanyahey da am mangay keyyak da nya a malalayo a komaro rana do heseb na. Am ji da nipanci do tao. Ta manyahey sira.
1234884,"Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. ",[Apnezak do niciyo am mirwa mavyay si Yeso.

1234885,"And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. ",Iya am nimangay manci nya do mazabab so onowned a mina kararay ni Yeso. 
1234886,"And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.",Mamizing da si Yeso a nimavyay rana a kapakamizing da pa si Madiya nimakacita rana sya am ji da nganoyngi.
1234887,"After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country. ",Mavitos o vazay ori am macitarek rana o pacittan na no kataotao na ni Yeso do rarwa ka mina kararay na a meypangay do ili da. 
1234888,And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.,Ipanci da do karwan da macinanao ji Yeso am ji da pa nganoyngi.
1234889,"Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. ","Ney manowji na am mapacita si Yeso do koman a asa so ikakarwan a macinanao jya.

1234894,"So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. ","Teyka na ni Yeso o aro a ciring a ipanci jira am meycyakavat rana mangay do teyngato a omlisna do wanan na ni Ama ta do to, "

1234904,"according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. ",ahapen na rana o iwawalam da macipangoyongoyot. So nisdep na do rako a panaralayan da do Yelosaleng a mapatanatanang so nakem da ji Ama ta do to.

",Karwan na ni Yeso o peyneynozyan da am mangay do vahay da no meyngaran so Simong. O mavakes a icyarwa ni Simong am nipadpes na. So nipasyasyan da ji Yeso. 
1235102,"And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.",Am ori o nyangay na tomita sya. So nipeytatanek na do katangked na kasirisiring na so ingingnen na am ji na rana nipaingwat. So nipeyvangon na rana tomaotao sira.
1235103,"Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. ",Somipsip o araw do makoyab am yai da no aro a tao o meykeyngeyngen ji Yeso kapaopta na so lima na jira ni Yeso a kapya da rana. 
1235104,"And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. ","Meyratateng am to ngyan pa so kalamsoyan ni Satan a nimapo do kataotao da no aro a tao a omlololos a manci no, ""Imo rana am Anak ka no Tao do to an."" So nioyyan na nira ni Yeso a ji na mya sira meyzezyak. Ta da katenngan o ka Misayya na."
1235105,"And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. ","Meyzengazengang am makowbot si Yeso a kangay na do kabwan no tao. Am ori o nikalan da sya no aro a tao. So nyangay da jya, do kaji da myan sya a komaro jira. "
1235106,"And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Beken a inyoo an, ta pasaklangen ko o kadwan no ili a pancyan ko no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to, do kakeykai na rana tomalamozong ninyo ni Ama ta do to.

1235107,And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.,Am ori o nyangay na mangnanao do peyneynozyan da do peycyeylilyan na do Yotay.
1235108,"And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, ",Ipisa am meytatanek si Yeso do pamsan na no rako a meybebneng a ranom a ngaranan da so Kenisale. Am meysilisilin sira o aro a tao a omamizing so ononongan na ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1235109,"and saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. ",Meyratateng am macita na o adwa ka vazangay do pamsan na nipeygegcinan no nimangahahap a tao a omoyas do tawaz da. 
1235110,"And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. ",Meyratateng am somakay si Yeso do vazangay na ni Simong a kapanci na nya komaod sya. Am ori o nikaodan na sya a mapahawang sya do pamsan na so alikey. Meyratateng am amlisna si Yeso do vazangay a kananao na sira so aro a tao.
1235111,"Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.","Iptad na o ciring na am maniring ji Simong am, ""Pakarairain mo pa o kaodan mo sya kazoyo nyo no tawaz nyo."" "
1235112,"And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. ","Maniring si Simong am, ""Mo Mangnanao, namen todazikna yakasahep a yameytawaz am yabwata namen nimamong. Am tana amizngen ko pala o ciring mo amzoyo no tawaz ko."" "
1235113,"And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. ",Am ori o nizoywan da rana no tawaz da. So nipakatawaz da so aro among a kaji na pisipisingan rana no tawaz da. 
1235114,"And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. ",Am ori o niraran da so kararay da somidong sira. Meyratateng am nipno da o adwa ka vazangay kaji na ranangnedan rana. 
1235115,"When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. ","Macita na ori ni Simong Pite am meylilitod do tangain na ni Yeso a manci no, ""Mo Panirsirngen, to mo na ngaroi yaken an. Ta ko meyraraten a tao an."" "
1235116,"For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: ",Si Simong rana kano kararay na tao am niyak da no mata o nimatawaz da aro among. 
1235117,"and so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.","O anak ni Sipitay a meyngaran si Yake a kani Yowani am akman sira so sang a omyak nya. Maniring si Yeso ji Simong am, ""Ji ka nyahey an, ta papwen mo sicyaraw eya o kakma moy mangahahap a tao a mapanop so aro a tao."" "
1235118,"And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.",So nipangid da rana kakaro da do aro a ipangahap da a macilolo rana ji Yeso.
1235119,"And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. ","Ipisa si Yeso amyan do asa ka ili am makacita so omlabyab so kolit a tao. Macita na si Yeso am mangay meylilitod do tangain na mapasyasi jya. Maniring am, ""No si apyahen mo am jyabo kaji na apyan no kataotao ko a."" "
1235120,"And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. ","So niparapongan na so lima na jya ni Yeso a kapanci na no, ""Ko apyahen. Apya rana o kataotao mo."" So ji na meyyahahai a nimapya no kolit na. "
1235121,"And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.","Pakoyokoin ni Yeso do tao ori am, ""Ji mo meycicicyan an.

1235122,"But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.",Meyratateng am ori o nipeylimwang na rana no ngaran na ni Yeso do dang. So nipeylovolovot da no aro a tao a omamizing so nanao na makza no keywakwak do kataotao da. 
1235123,"And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed. ",Am masangib si Yeso a komaro jira mangay a meynozi do kabwan no tao.
1235124,"And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Jud&#230; a, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.","Ipisa mangnanao si Yeso am amyan so makanateng a tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to.

1235125,"And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him. ",Amyan so nyai da a ji makapeyvangon a tao do ireyrayan na. So vovwan da jya isdep do tangain na ni Yeso. 
1235126,"And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus. ","Ikongo do tey yaro tao, am ori o ji da makasdepi nya. Meyratateng am to da rana ngalatan do atep no vahay a kakabkab da so atep na katonton da sya pazomtaden do tangain na ni Yeso. "
1235127,"And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.","Makazazap na ni Yeso o onowned da a omanoyong jya. Am ori o nipancyan na nya jya so, ""Imo rana am yarana nimavonas o raraten mo."" "
1235128,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? ","Am ori o nikazyakan da nya no tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to. So nipancyan da no, ""Sinosino o tao eya a yato nazovaz si Ama ta do to. Ta si Ama ta do to saon o makavonas so raraten no tao."" "
1235129,"But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?","Katenngan na ni Yeso o nakenakem da. Am ori o nipeycirngan na jira so, ""Ikongo nyo ikakman sang so nakenakem. "
1235130,"Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?","Manngwa, apyapya o kapanci nya do meyngen a tao so, 'Yanimavonas rana o raraten mo'? No apyapya o kapanci no, 'Tanek rana kalam mo rana.' "
1235131,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy, ) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.","Ta ko kakzeben inyo a makateneng do oyowyat ko a Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao a makavonas so raraten no tao. So pancyan ko nya do meyngen a tao so, 'Tanek rana kahap mo so ireyrayan mo a mangay rana do vahay nyo.'"" "
1235132,"And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. ",So mina to na meytatanki no tao ang do tangain da no aro a tao a kahap na rana so ireyrayan na somaray nya ji Ama ta do to a mangay rana do vahay da. 
1235133,"And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.","So nipeyzokaban da nya no aro a tao a isaray ji Ama ta do to a manci no, ""Sicyaraw rana ya am yanamen nimakacita so yamapeyzokab a vazay."""
1235134,"And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.","Makowbot si Yeso am makacita so asa ka mapeyvazay so deyking a tao a meyngaran si Diwey a amlisna do torotorwan no deyking a vahay. Maniring jya am, ""Macilolo ka jyaken an."" "
1235135,"And he left all, rose up, and followed him. ",So nikarwan na rana do vazay na kapacilolo na rana jya.
1235136,And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. ,Meyratateng am taotawwen na si Yeso do vahay da. So ikaro no macitovong jira mapeyvazay so deyking a kano karwan no tao a macyakan jira. 
1235137,"But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? ","Ori o nikazyakan da nya no tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o nipancyan da nya do macinanao ji Yeso so, ""Ikongo nyo ipacihanghang do mangangap so deyking a kano aro a meyraraten a tao."" "
1235138,"And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""O apiya so kataotao am ji da ngala o koysang an. Ta o meyngen a tao am ori o komala sya. "
1235139,"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.","Ta yaken rana am beken a ko manara so ji meyraraten a tao an. Ta vazay ko o kapanci ko no meyraraten a tao a mamlis so nakenakem an."""
1235140,"And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink? ","Yamyan so tao a manci nya ji Yeso.

1235141,"And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Manngwa, no mamaring sira so kanen o matarek so vahay a tao am ji nyo mya sira o tao da koman? Jyabo kakman na sang a. "
1235142,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.","No marateng rana o araraw na no irakep da so mahakay am, ori rana o ikanoyong da ji mangakaday."""
1235143,"And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.","Mangononong pa jira so pehngehngayan na sya so ciring.

1235144,"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.","Yabo tao a mangap so vayo a potaw cyo a paglowen do adan a niparing a kolit no baka, ta zombak. "
1235145,But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.,"Am ori an, o paglowan so vayo a potaw cyo do vayo a kolit no baka an. "
1235146,"No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.","Abo tao a nimyop rana so adan a potaw cyo a keyyop na pa so vayo a potaw cyo. Ta ji na tahamtam o kapyapya pa no adan a potaw cyo."""
1235147,"And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. ",Ipisa kapeywalam no tao am mangonong sira Yeso a kano macinanao jya do nihakawan a mogi. Am to sira mangoztod so aknatahen da no macinanao ji Yeso. 
1235148,"And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days? ","Maniring sira o tao a macyagom do Vadisay am, ""Adan rana o akman sang a vazay do ipeywalam no tao?"" "
1235149,"And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Manngwa, ji nyo pa nivilangan o vazay da da Tawey a kano kararay na tao no kakcin da? "
1235150,"how he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?","Ta nisomdep si Tawey do raralayan da ni Ama ta do to a kapangap na so nipatanang da myanpaw a kanen a katoro na pa nya do kararay na.

1235151,"And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.","Maniring pa jira si Yeso am, ""O Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a tao o meymatmatngeh no araraw no ipeywalam no tao."""
1235152,"And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered. ",Ipisa kapeywalam no tao am somdep si Yeso do peyneynozyan da mangnanao so tao. Am amyan dang so asa ka tao a meykazakazain so lima do wanan na. 
1235153,"And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him. ","O mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a kano tao a macyagom do Vadisay am kalahen da o karatan na ni Yeso. ""Manngo paro, ala mangiwakwak so meykeyngeyngen do ipeywalam no tao ang.

1235154,"But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.

1235155,"Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?","Maniring jira si Yeso am, ""Ko inyo pacicyan am ikongo iwawalam ta do ipeywalam no tao.

1235156,"And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other. ","Am ori o nicittan na so aro a tao a kapanci na nya do tao ang so, ""Zanet pala o lima mo."" Zaneten na am todapya rana. "
1235157,And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus. ,Ori o nikarakorako na pa no kaoyyan da ni Yeso. Am ori o nipeysirisiring da do ahapan da sya.

1235239,"And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman?

",Amyan sira do avak no rako a meybebneng a ranom am to ngitkeh rana si Yeso. Meyratateng am to na ngirasa sira no rako a pagpag a kalokong na jira no paopaong na do vazangay da so cinapodaro. 
1235269,"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. ","Am ori o nyangay da amyokay si Yeso. Maniring sira am, ""Mo Mangnanao, mo Mangnanao, tanyo na marahet!"" Mayokay si Yeso am sirsirngen na o rako a pagpag a kano paopaong am nikakeykai na rana meyhanahanang. "
1235270,"And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Nyo ji meyhanhanan nyaken."" So nisavasavakan da nya. Maniring sira do kadwan jira am, ""Sinosino ya tao. Ta na to nirsirnga o rako a pagpag am na to ngamiznga."""
1235271,"And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee. ","Makaranes sira do meyngaran so Kelasen a ili a katovangan no Cyadidi am, "
1235272,"And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs. ","nigomcin rana si Yeso a makasinmo so asa ka kovotan no kalamsoyan ni Satan a tao do dang. Iya rana am ji meyyayob. Ji meyvahay do ili, ta meyvahay do kanitwan. "
1235273,"When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not. ","Macita na si Yeso am omlololos a kapeylilitod na do tangain na ni Yeso. Maniring am, ""Mo Yeso a Anak no ney manokdwan na Tao do to, ikongo mo gogadan nyaken. Ji mo pasingsingci yaken an."" "
1235274,"(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.) ",O pancyan na no nang am nivozwaw na ni Yeso o komovot do dang a aro a kalamsoyan ni Satan. Masangib ori a kovotan da no kalamsoyan ni Satan. No kaneb da jya am to na zavazavata o nivaod da so ai na vahalang a kapaksoz da sya no kalamsoyan ni Satan a yangay do kabwan no tao. 
1235275,"And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him. ","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""Sino ngaran mo."" Pasapan na am, ""Si Malavong."" Ta aro a kalamsoyan ni Satan a komovot jya. "
1235276,And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep. ,So nipasyasi da no aro a kalamsoyan ni Satan ji Yeso a manci no kaji na paksozan sira a tovoin do abo so takadan a gazawagaw. 
1235277,And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them. ,O macitangked jira tokon am macinao o keyyan da dang no aro a kois. Am ori o nipasyasi da no kalamsoyan ni Satan ji Yeso do katovoy na sira do aro a kois. Meyratateng am tovoin na sira ni Yeso. 
1235278,"Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked. ",Am ori o nikarwan da do kataotao no tao a mangay do aro a kois kaksoz da do alalasyas a katovoz da do rako a meybebneng a ranom. Ori o nipeykehmehmes da a mawakwak.
1235279,"When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country. ",Macita da no tomalamozong no kois am malalayo sira manci nya do aro a tao do ili a kano meyvahay do takey. 
1235280,"Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. ","So nipeygonoz no tao a mangay a tomita so vazay ang.

Am ori o nikarahet da so onowned a to rana nyahey a tomita sya, ta tey arako oyowyat ni Yeso. "
1235281,They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.,"O nimakacita so vazay ori a tao am ononongan da rana do aro a tao o panpandan na. Maniring sira am, ""Yanimapya rana o nikovotan no aro a kalamsoyan ni Satan asyo."" "
1235282,"Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear; and he went up into the ship, and returned back again. ",O tao do Kelasen am ipanci da si Yeso a komaro jira. Ta manyahey sira. So nisakay na rana do vazangay a mangay rana. 
1235283,"Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, ","O nimapya nikovotan no kalamsoyan ni Satan a tao am ikakza na o kapacikavang na ji Yeso am ji na mya. So nipancyan na nya, "
1235284,"Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him. ","""Mangay ka rana do vahay nyo a kapanci mo no mina vazay na jimo ni Ama ta do to."" So nyangay na rana do ili a meylimwang no mina vazay na jya ni Yeso."
1235285,"And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.",Meysinaoli si Yeso do katovangan na no rako a meybebneng a ranom am mangay da rapongen no nimnanala sya aro a tao. 
1235286,"And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: ","Amyan so asa ka tomalamozong no peyneynozyan a meyngaran so Yalo a mai a mapasyasi do tangain ni Yeso karara na si Yeso a mangay do vahay da, "
1235287,"for he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.",ta makeykai rana mawakwak o veyvowen na anak a mavakes. O kakawakawan no nang am adwa so ikarwa (12). Mangonong si Yeso do rarahan am meysilisilin o aro a tao a macihza jya. 
1235288,"And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, ",Amyan so asa ka mavakes adwa so ikarwa so awawan a makaliliw so kataotao na gomcin no rala. Nimimin na o kangangay na yangay na do mangavavaw am abo angangayan na. 
1235289,"came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched. ",So nyangay na do likod na ni Yeso a kapinan na do seysayan no talili na. Am ori o nikapya na rana no ingingnen na. 
1235290,"And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? ","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Sino ya niminan jyaken ang."" Abo o tao a manci nya. Maniring si Pite am, ""Mo Mangnanao, mo panangangayan nya.

1235291,"And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Yamyan so yaniminan jyaken, ta ko nimaliliw o oyowyat ko a makowbot jyaken."" "
1235292,"And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. ","Meylamdam na no mavakes o kaji na rana makapowziban so kanimapya na rana am to zikzik a mangay a meylilitod do tangain ni Yeso kapanci na no peypeypangayan no mina kapinan na jya, na kapya rana no ingingnen na.

1235293,"And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""Manganako, ka manoyong a meyhanhan nyaken. Makapiya ka so onowned a mangay rana. Ta yarana apya o ingingnen mo."""
1235294,"While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead: trouble not the Master. ","Ji na pa teyka o ciring na am amyan so tao a nimapo do vahay da Yalo a manci no, ""Ji mo na rara si Yeso, ta yanimaliman rana o anak mo."" "
1235295,"But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.","Mamizing na ni Yeso am ipanci na ji Yalo. Maniring am, ""Ji ka nyaheyan. Si manoyong o kapeyhanhan mo nyaken am apya rana ori a."" "
1235296,"And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. ",Makaranes sira Yeso do vahay da ni Yalo am si Pite a kani Yowani a kani Yake a kano inyapwan no kanakan o nipya na macisdep jya. 
1235297,"And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.","Lavyan da no aro a tao o kanakan. Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Ji kanyo lavi, ta yamitkeh ori. Yamakongo kwan nyo."" "
1235298,"And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. ","Mamizing da o ciring ni Yeso am no mangay o kaming da am mangay o kapeyoyaoya da, do kapakateneng da jya a nimawakwak rana. "
1235299,"And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.","Meyratateng am pinanan na o lima na kalolos na manci no, ""Mo ovay, peyvangon rana."" "
1235300,"And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat. ","So nipeysinaoli no pahad na kapeyvangon na rana. Meyratateng am ipanci na sira ni Yeso. Maniring am, ""Pantaney kamo so kanen na."" "
1235301,And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.,"Yeyyak da no inyapwan no kanakan. Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Ji nyo meyvehvehyan o ko mina vazay do tao an."""
1235302,"Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. ","Lovoten na ni Yeso sira o rarwa so ikakarwan a macinanao jya kapanta na nira so oyowyat da ipamozwaw da so kalamsoyan ni Satan a kano ipangiwakwak da so meykeyngeyngen a tao, "
1235303,"And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. ",katovoy na sira mangay a meylimwang no ciriciring na do katalamozong na nyaten ni Ama ta do to a kapangiwakwak da so meyngen a tao. 
1235304,"And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.","Maniring jira am, ""No mangay kamo na am ji kamo meyyaomas. Ji kamo mapalolo so sisikod nyo a kano kanen nyo a kano nizpi nyo an. Ji nyo peytapila o ayob nyo. "
1235305,"And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.","No somdep kamo do asa ka vahay am to kamo na ngiseysan do dang an, mangay do ikaro nyo na jira. "
1235306,"And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.","No ji da naotawwa inyo am karwan nyo o ili da katoktok nyo so tana do ai nyo. Ta itovil nyo jira meyraraten a tao a ji mamlis so nakenakem."" "
1235307,"And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.",So nyangay da omlivolivon do peycyeylilyan na a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a kapangiwakwak da so ingingnen no tao.
1235308,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead; ",Mamizing no panirsirngen no Cyadidi a meyngaran si Helote o aro a vazay ni Yeso am marahet o onowned na. Ta ji na tenngi o kapwan na no vazay na ni Yeso. Ta patolinen da si Yeso ji Yowani a nimirwa a mavyay. 
1235309,"and of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. ",Amyan so tao a manci nya si Idiya a nimai. So iyan no tao a manci no kanimavyay no asa ka panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to no kakwa pa. 
1235310,"And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.","Maniring si Helote am, ""Jyabo ka si Yowani na. Nipotowan ko na o oo na asyoo. Sinosino tao ang. Asyo o aro a vazay na paha."" Am ori o to na naknakmi so kapakacita na sya."
1235311,"And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. ","No kapeysinaoli da no rarwa so ikakarwan a nipamnekan na ni Yeso a amlivolivon no ciriciring na am kakadain da o mina vazay da ipanci jya, kapalolo na sira ni Yeso a komaro do dang a kangay na nira do asa ka ili a meyngaran so Peysayta. "
1235312,"And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing. ",Katenngan da no aro a tao am macihza sira mangay. So nirapongan na sira ni Yeso kapanci na nya so katalamozong na nyaten ni Ama ta do to a kapangiwakwak na so aro a meykeyngeyngen a tao. 
1235313,"And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place. ","Somipsip o araw am mangay o rarwa so ikakarwan do tangain ni Yeso. Maniring sira jya am, ""To ta na mancyan o aro a tao a mangay an, kangay da meykala do ili so kanen da kano isanan da.

1235314,"But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people. ","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Pantan kamo sira so kanen da."" Maniring sira ji Yeso am, ""Yalima ka myanpaw a kano yadwa ka among o yamyan jyamen.

1235315,"For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.","O mahakay rana no kano nang am kakaliman sira ranaw (5000).

1235316,"And they did so, and made them all sit down. ",So nionotan da do ciring na no macinanao jya. So nilisna da rana no aro a tao. 
1235317,"Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. ",Meyratateng am ahapen na rana o alima ka myanpaw a kano adwa ka among a katangara na so hanit a kasaray na nya ji Ama ta do to a kakcikcil na sya patodahen do macinanao jya kavonong da rana sya do aro a tao.

1235319,"And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?","Ipisa maveyvow si Yeso a meynozi am mangay da citahen no macinanao jya. Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Sino kwan da yaken no aro a tao."" "
1235320,"They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.

1235321,"He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God. ","Maniring jira si Yeso am, ""Manngo kamo. Sino kwan nyo yaken."" Maniring si Pite am, ""Imo rana am Kizisto ka apo ji Ama ta do to."" "
1235322,"And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing; ","O nipakoyokoy na pa jira am, ""Ji nyo meycicicyan o akman sang a vazay do tao an."""
1235323,"saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.","Maniring pa jira am, ""Yamai o aro alalaw ko a Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to an, a peymakarwan da no kamanrarakehan a kano kabedbedan da rana panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano mangnanao so iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a tao a kawakwak da rana jyaken.

1235324,"And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.","Maniring pa jira si Yeso am, ""No myan so tao a macilolo jyaken am to na pangawawan o kataotao na somabway no jyojika na a macihza jyaken.

1235325,"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.",Ta o tao a makza no kasaray na do karawan am beken a ikapya na ori. Am o to ngawaw pa no kataotao na a mahap so vazay ko am mahap na o to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad na.

1235327,"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.",No myan so macimanig nyaken a kano ciring ko am no meysinaoli ko a Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a macihza do azwazway ni Ama ta do to a kano aro a tinsi am abo nakenakem ko sya.

1235329,"And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. ",Ikawao na araw no nipancyan na no aro a ciriciring am palolwen na si Pite a kani Yowani a kani Yake a mangay do tokon a meynozi. 
1235330,"And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering. ",Meynozi si Yeso am todablis o keyteytawan na. So mina to na lavangi a maniray so ayob. 
1235331,"And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: ","Meyratateng am meyhekas o rarwa ka tao a macisirsiring jya. Sira rana o rarwa am si Moyse a kani Idiya, "
1235332,"who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. ",nimablis so keyteytawan. Ipeysirsiring da kani Yeso o kawakwak na do Yelosaleng a mapakavos so nitoro na jya ni Ama ta do to a vazay na. 
1235333,"But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. ",Si Pite a kano kararay na am makapya sira mitkeh. Mayokay sira am macita da si Yeso a kano rarwa a meytatanek a macitazing jya a mablis so keyteytawan. 
1235334,"And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said. ","To da ji ngaroi si Yeso no rarwa ori am maniring si Pite ji Yeso am, ""Mo Mangnanao, tanyo tey yapya do jya. So ipamaring namen so atlo a ka sarwap, asa imo, asa si Moyse, asa si Idiya.""

1235335,"While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. ",Ji pa ngavos o ciring na am amyan so asa ka cinalab a ombengbeng sira. So nikanyahey da Pite. 
1235336,"And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. ","Meyratateng am amyan so ciriciring do cinalab a manci no, ""Iya rana am nipamnekan ko Anak ko. So amizngan nyo sya an."" "
1235337,"And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.",Amizngen da o ciring ori am si Yeso o macita da asa ka tao. Do araraw no nang am ji da meycicicyan o nimacita da vazay do tao.
1235338,"And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him. ",Ikadwa na araw am omosok sira apo do tokon. So nirapongan da sya no aro a tao. 
1235339,"And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child. ","Meyratateng am amyan dang so asa ka tao amlololos. Maniring am, ""Mo Mangnanao, ikasi mo pa o anak ko an. Ta iya rana am yako veyvowen a anak ko. "
1235340,"And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him. ",Yamasangib ori a na kovotan no kalamsoyan ni Satan. Ori o to na lololosi a mamezamezay a meyotaotab so ngongoy. Ji na ngaroi no kalamsoyan ni Satan. So to na makasii a meyzaza so kataotao. 
1235341,And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. ,"Nipanci ko o macinanao jimo a omvozwaw sya am da jyavozwaw."" "
1235342,"And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Ikongo nyo ji meyhanhani ni Ama ta do to. Akman rana so wanjin o kownownay ko a macikaop jinyo. Akman ko rana so wanjin a marilaw ninyo."" Maniring do tao ori am, ""Ayyan o anak mo do jya."" "
1235343,"And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.",Makaranes o anak na am paleklekteken na no kalamsoyan ni Satan a kapamezamezay na. Ori o nioyyan na nya ni Yeso so kalamsoyan ni Satan. Am ori o nikapya na rana no kanakan a katoro na rana nya do ama na. 
1235344,"And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, ",Am ori o nisavasavakan da no oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to no aro a tao. Isavasavak da o mina vazay ni Yeso. So niyan no ciring na do macinanao jya. 
1235345,Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.,"Maniring am, ""Ji nyo ngawawan o ipanci ko a ciring an. Yaken rana a Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to am makeykai da yaken a itoro do macioya jyaken an."" "
1235346,"But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.","Am ji da tenngi o peypeypangayan no ciriciring na, ta masalit o ayyaingan na. Am ori o ji da makatenngi jya. Am ji dadkeci a ipanahes o peypeypangayan no nipanci na vazay."
1235347,"Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest. ",Ikazyak da no macinanao jya sino jira o pakarakehen a tao. 
1235348,"And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him, ","Katenngan na ni Yeso o nakenakem da. Am ori o nipancyan na no asa ka kanakan a mai, kapanci na nya meytatanek do katangked na. "
1235349,"and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.","Maniring jira am, ""O mahap so vazay ko a tomaotao so kanakan eya am yaken an o taotawwen da an.

1235523,"He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.","Meyratateng am mangononong si Yeso so pehngehngayan na sya. Maniring am, ""Amyan so asa ka tao a meymowa so ovako a kayo. Mownay am naknakmen na o kapeykala na so asi na am ji makakala. "
1235524,"Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?","Maniring do lamlamsoy na am, 'Yana katlo a kawan o kayo eya yako nimowa am yapa ji nimeyyasi.

1235525,"And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:","Maniring o lamlamsoy na am, 'Ji kakman sang so nakenakem. Aidan ta pala so kasa kawan a peyveyveknen. "
1235526,"and if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.","Simakseysawan a kapeyyasi na am ori o vezedan ta sya. No si ji meyyasi am ori o atbahan ta na sya.'"""
1235527,And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.,Ipisa kapeywalam no tao am mangnanao do peyneynozyan si Yeso. 
1235528,"And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. ",Amyan dang so asa ka mavakes a kovotan no kalamsoyan ni Satan. Nimeyngen a mina kawao so ikarwa (18) so awawan. Am ori o ipeyvovokoz na a ji rana meysonong so likod a tomanek. 
1235529,"And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.","Macita na ni Yeso am tawagan na. Maniring jya am, ""Mo kavakes, na nikarwan imo rana no ingingnen mo."" "
1235530,"And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. ",Paoptahen na o lima na ni Yeso am ji nimeyyahahay ori a matazineng rana so kataotao. Ori o nisarayan na nya ji Ama ta do to.
1235531,"And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. ","Macita na no tomalamozong no peyneynozyan si Yeso a mangiwakwak so ingingnen do ipeywalam no tao am meyoyaoya. Maniring do aro a tao am, ""Yakanem araw o tamo ipeyvazay.

1235532,"The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Inyo rana a mapakapyapya so nakem a tao am manngwa, nyo ji pakana o makakaday a vinyay nyo do ipeywalam no tao?

1235533,"And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?","Yamyan do jya so sivovoong ni Apolahan a yana wao so ikarwa (18) so awawan a na nivaod ni Satan.

1235534,"And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.",Mamizing da o ciring ni Yeso no maoya nya tao am meylatlatlat sira. Am nisaray da no aro a tao o mina vazay na jira.

1235537,"And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Ikongo o payyaingan ko so italamozong na ni Ama ta do to. "

1235553,"And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. ",Ipisa kapeywalam no tao am mangay macyakan si Yeso do asa ka tao a macyagom do Vadisay do vahay da. Am ori o nileylamdaman da sya no maoya nya tao.

1235558,And they could not answer him again to these things.,Mamizing da o ciring ni Yeso am ji da na tenngi a pasapan.
1235559,"And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them, ",Macita na ni Yeso o macihanghang jya a tao mangay omlisna do apya a lilisnan am nipanci na jira o payyaingen na sya. 
1235560,"When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;","Maniring am, ""No nipanoyon da inyo no mamaring so kanen a tao am ji kanyo lisna do pamanongan na an.

1235564,"Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.","Maniring si Yeso do tomaotao sya a tao am, ""No manaotao ka am ji ka manaid so kagagan mo a kano kakteh mo a kano zipos mo a kano katenngan a tao a kataib mo.

1235567,"And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. ","Mamizing na no asa ka tao a macihanghang ji Yeso am amyan so ciring na jya. Maniring am, ""Tey rako o sarasaray da no macihanghang do italamozong ni Ama ta do to a tao."" "

1235569,"and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.","Marateng o araraw no ipamaring da so kanen am manovoy so lamlamsoy na do nitaidan na tao. Maniring jira am, 'Sijya kamo na, ta yana nipeykakasa o aro a kanekanen.' "
1235570,"And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.","Am mamimin sira ji ngonot jya. Maniring o asa ka tao am, 'Ko kapanazang pa so hakawan. So ko yangay a tomita pa sya. So ji mo ngozai jyaken an.' "
1235571,"And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.","Maniring o asa ka tao am, 'Yako nimanazang so yasa ngarnan a baka. Ko yangay abwabwangen pa sira do ko palaman sira. Kapakamo mo am ji ko angay.' "
1235572,"And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.","Maniring o asa ka tao am, 'Ko kapapapen pa. Am ori o ji ko angai.' "
1235573,"So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.","Meysinaoli o lamlamsoy na am ipanci na o ciring da do lawpan na.

1235574,"And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.","Meyratateng am to na mangozai no lamlamsoy na o ciring na. Meysinaoli am ipanci na do lawpan na, 'Ko na nimimin a nipeyvazay o ciring mo am yapa myan so lilisnan a yakabwan no tao.' "
1235575,"And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.","Maniring o lawpan do lamlamsoy na am, 'To ka nangay do rararahan a manara so tao kapno da do vahay ko. "

1235609,"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:","Maniring o ama na do lamlamsoy na am, 'Pangapey kamo so ney yapiya na ayob na, kapasaong nyo jya so tamtamek namen, kapantan nyo nya so tokap na, "
1235610,"and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:",kangay nyo mangap so singasingeh no vinyay namen a pamaringan ta so kanen. 
1235611,"for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.",Ta o anak ko rana ya am yakmey nimawakwak a na kavyay rana. Ta yakmey nimabo a apzapzatan a na kapeytotwaw rana.' Am ori o nipakapya da nisomaray nya.
1235612,"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.","""Omoli rana o rakerakeh a anak na nimapo do hakawan da am mamizing na rana o somaray do vahay da. "
1235613,"And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.",Am ori o nitawagan na do asa ka lamlamsoy da pacicin. 
1235614,"And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.","Maniring o lamlamsoy na am, 'Na nimacita ni ama mo si wari mo a yapya so kataotao a yanimai rana. Am ori o na nipangapan nya so ney yapiya na do vinyay nyo.' "
1235615,"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.",Mamizing na no rakerakeh a anak na am to rana meyoyaoya. Am ori o ji na nisomdepi. Mamizing na ni ama na am ipanci na macilimot jira. 
1235616,"And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:","Maniring do ama na am, 'To mo na naknakman, ta yako rana jyatenngi o zikzikna ko so vazay ta a yaji mapasobna do ciriciring mo.

1235617,"but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.",Am si wari rana am yana nipeyvwak o kangangay mo do na peyvozawan. Yameysinaoli am yamo ipangap so ney yapiya na vinyay ta.'

1235619,"It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.","Am si wari mo rana am yakmey nimawakwak a na kavyay an. Yakmey yanimabo a apzapzatan a na kapeytotwaw rana an. Am ori o ji na alasi no kasaray ta nya an.'"""
1235620,"And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.","Maniring si Yeso do macinanao jya am, ""Amyan so asa ka lamlamsoy no katenngan a tao. Amyan so tao a omraherahet sya. Maniring do katenngan a tao am, 'Na to peyvwaka o warawara mo no lamlamsoy mo.' "
1235621,"And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.","Mamizing no lawpan da am tawagan na a mai. Maniring jya am, 'Yamyan so ko nimamizing a vazay mo. Itoro mo na jyaken o vatvatek no peymasaodan ko, ta ji ko na pahanhana imo a tomalamozong nya.' "
1235622,"Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.",Mamizing no lamlamsoy na am manakenakem do onowned na. 'Si pagcinen na yaken no lawpan am ikongo pa vazay ko. Si amhakakaw ko am jyabo ko oyowyat a. Si macyakakan ko am ji ko asnek. 
1235623,"I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.",No si abo vazay ko am apyapya rana o kato ko na macivahayan do manci nyaken a kagagan ko.' 
1235624,"So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?","Meyratateng am mangay na kakadain sira a ipanci o nimamood do lawpan na so nizpi. Maniring do asa am, 'Yapira o nivood mo do lawpan ko.' "
1235625,"And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.","Maniring am, 'Yasa poo (100) ka vakvaklit no haneng.' Maniring o lamlamsoy na am, 'O nivood mo ori am pahephepan ta, kalima na rana ngarnan (50).' "
1235626,"Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.","Maniring do asa am, 'Yapira jimo.' Maniring am, 'Yasa poo (100) a kalavalavat no mogis.' Maniring o lamlamsoy na am, 'O nivood mo ori am pahephepan ta, kawao na rana ngarnan (80).' "
1235627,"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.","Mamizing na no lawpan na am isaray na o lamlamsoy ori, do katey mapatak na a mangamaog so vazay a ipeypapyan na so kataotao na.""

1235630,"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?",No marahet o ahahapan nyo so peymasaodan nyo do karawan am jyabo kapahanhan na jinyo ni Ama ta do to a tomalamozong no peymeymasaodan na do teyngato a.

1235632,"No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","""Abo o lamlamsoy a meyvazay do rarwa ka lawpan. No ikanig na o asa am ikaoya na o asa. No ikaoya na o asa am ikaglaw na o asa.

1235633,"And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. ","Mamizing da no tao a macyagom do Vadisay o ciring na ni Yeso am ipeykeykaming da, ta ikakza da o nizpi. "
1235634,"And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.","Maniring jira si Yeso am, ""Kanyo mapakapyapya so nakem do tangain no tao.

1235643,"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.","Meyratateng am tawagan na.

1235644,"But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.","Am maniring si Apolahan am, 'Manganako, mo pa manakem no kapeyigegen mo do karawan asyo an, a to meypanpan do kanekanen mo an.

1235744,"But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.","Ikongo do pacioyyan da ori no keylyan da, am ori o nipanovoy da so tao a mangay manci nya do rako a panirsirngen da so kaji dakzan nya a panirsirngen da. "
1235745,"And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.",Mahap na o panirsirngen no meynakem a tao am meysinaoli rana do vahay da.

1235750,"And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:","Mai o ikatlo no lamlamsoy na am ipanci na, 'Lawpan, o mo nitoro jyaken a nizpi am yapa myan do jya. Ko nipakapya ya nikekeh no milakayob. "
1235751,"for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.",Ta ko imo ikanyahey a tey malalansoken a tao a yamapamoon so beken a monganay jimo a yakomali so beken a mo nipamowa.' 
1235752,"And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:","Maniring o lawpan jya am, 'Imo rana ya am yaka tey rahet a lamlamsoy ko an.

1235758,"And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. ",Mateyka na o aro a ciring na ni Yeso am meypangay rana sira do Yelosaleng. 
1235759,"And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, ",To da ji makaranes do Peyvake a kado Potani do asa ka tokon a meyngaran so Kanlan am tovoin na o rarwa ka macinanao jya manma.

1235761,"And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.","No si myan so manci nya tao jinyo so, 'Nyo ovayan so baka ang,' am ipanci nyo jira o, 'Yamyan so na patakan nya no Panirsirngen ta.'"""
1235762,"And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. ",Mangay sira am jyalas o nipanci ni Yeso jira.

1235764,"And they said, The Lord hath need of him. ","Maniring sira am, ""Yamyan so na patakan nya no Panirsirngen ta."" "
1235765,"And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. ","Meyratateng am ovain da na o baka a yangay do tangain na ni Yeso, karasay da no ayob da do likod no baka a kapasakay da na si Yeso. "

1235793,"So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?",Meyratateng am lolwen da yangay do kwang a kawakwak da rana sya. Manngo kamo. Kongkongwen na paro o nimvood so nihakawan na tao ang no mapeynihakawan sya.

1235797,And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them. ,O mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a kano panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am makazazap da o nanao ni Yeso a paingen na jira.

1235813,"but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:",O tao a peyvangonen ni Ama ta do to no makwa a mangay do teyngato am ji sira meypinazagpit an. 
1235814,"neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.","Ta akman sira so tinsi do yanan ni Ama ta do to a jyawakwak rana. Anak na sira ni Ama ta do to, ta nipeyvangon na sira. "

1235888,"And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""O panirsirngen rana do karawan am abo ji ngamizing so akman sang a tao an.

1235889,"But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.",Am ji kamo akman so sang an. Ta o pakarakehen nyo am ji na pahama o nakem na. O panirsirngen am inarahen na o kakma ney lamlamsoy a manidong so tao.

1235892,"And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;",Am ori o torwan ko nya jinyo so na nitoro jyaken ni Ama oyowyat na.

1235894,"And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:","Maniring pa si Yeso am, ""Mo Simong, cittey si Satan a nipya ni Ama ta do to a mangay a omlita jinyo. "
1235895,"but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.","Am ko na nipeynozi imo. So ji na ablisi no nakenakem mo jyaken. No mamlis ka so nakenakem am vavagan mo sira o akma moy kakteh do cinai an."" "
1235896,"And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. ","Maniring si Pite jya am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, ko na ninakenakem o kapacihza ko jimo do pamemtengan, kapeynanod ta mawakwak do dang."" "
1235897,"And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Mo Pite, ko pa ciring jimo am sicyamahep rana do itazokokok no manok am ipitlo ka omalalas jyaken."""
1235898,"And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. ","Maniring pa si Yeso jira am, ""No kakwa pa am nitovoy ko inyo a ji mapalolo so peyninizpyan a kano aywayob nyo a kano tokap nyo. Am ikongo pa yabo jinyo.""

1235899,"Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Am o na yanan no peyninizpyan na kano ayob sicyaikwaya am palolwen da.

1235901,"And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.","Maniring o macinanao jya am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, cittey o yadwa ka cinalolot do jya."" Maniring si Yeso am, ""Cyana ori."""

1235903,"And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.","Makaranes sira do dang am ipanci na jira ni Yeso. Maniring am, ""Meynozi kamo an, ta kalittan kamo an."""
1235904,"And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, ",Meyratateng am karwan na sira ni Yeso so kabneng no keytan so karairai a kapeylilitod na meynozi. 
1235905,"saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.","Maniring am, ""Mo Ama, no si apyahen mo am pakarwen mo o yamasagpaw a alalaw ko an. Am ji mo mangozai o nakenakem ko, ta kapangozay mo do nakenakem mo."" "
1235906,"And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. ",Amyan so asa ka tinsi a nimapo do teyngato a nimangay a omait do oyowyat na. 
1235907,And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. ,Ta no kapeynozi na am tey meyngen o onowned na. So icyakman na so rala no anngennget na amiteng. Am arakorako pa o pasyasyan na ni Yeso ji Ama ta do to.
1235908,"And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, ","Teyka meynozi am meytatanek si Yeso a mangay do macinanao jya. Makaranes jira am macita na sira meycyaititkeh, ta mapoo sira do kapakanakem da so yaomanam a alalaw ni Yeso. "

1235910,"And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. ",Ji pa nikomavos o ciring ni Yeso am mangay sira o aro a tao a palolwen na no asa ka macinanao jya a meyngaran so Yota. Iya rana am to manmanma a mangay omrapong si Yeso.

1235912,"When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?","Macita da no karwan da no macinanao ji Yeso am ipanci da, ""Mo Panirsirngen, apya kapanavaz namen no takzes?"" "
1235913,"And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. ",Patavazen no asa ka tao jira o takzes na do lamlamsoy na no panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to. Am ori o nikakteb no talinga na do wanan na.

1235915,"Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?","Meyratateng am maniring si Yeso do amrakep sya panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano panipanirsirngen da no omzat do rako a panaralayan a kano kamanrarakehan da am, ""Kamo mapalolo so takzes nyo a kano sisipzot nyo a yamrakep jyaken?

1235916,"When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.","Ko mangday so araraw a yamacitovong jinyo do rako a panaralayan am yanyo ji ngapa yaken.

1235917,"Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off. ",No kanang am rakpen da si Yeso a kangay da nya do vahay da no panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to. To na macyazizazawi si Yeso ni Pite. 
1235918,"And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. ",Meyratateng am manangdang sira do inaorod no vahay da amlimot so apoy. Si Pite rana am macikaop do aro a tao a manangdang. 
1235919,"But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. ","Macita na no asa ka tobang da si Pite a macipanangdang am to na ningkaji. Maniring am, ""Kapacihcihza no nya ji Yeso asyo am."" "
1235920,"And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. ","Maniring si Pite am, ""Ko jyasingkaji ori."" "
1235921,"And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. ","Ji pa meyyonownay am to ngyan pa so tao a tomita sya. Maniring am, ""Kapacihcihza mo ji Yeso asyo am."" Maniring si Pite am, ""Ko jyatenngi mo ipanci ang."" "
1235922,"And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galil&#230; an. ","Hatasen na o asa ka vatvatek no toki am to ngyan pa so asa ka tao a to rana mapatopos so ciring na a manci no, ""Jyabo kalas na. Beken a imo eya o yanimacihza ji Yeso? Ta ka macikeylyan jya."" "
1235923,"And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. ","Maniring si Pite am, ""Ko jyatenngi o mo ipanci ang."" Ji na pa teyka o ciring na am nitazokokokan na rana no manok. "
1235924,"And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. ","Meyvazingowngaw si Yeso a tomita si Pite am manakem na o mina ciring na jya ni Yeso a manci no, ""Do itazokokok no manok am ipitlo ka omalalas jyaken."" "
1235925,"And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.",Manakem na ori ni Pite am makowbot rana omzezezeng a amlavi.
1235926,"And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. ","O tomita si Yeso a tao am peyyaliliman da kasipsipzot da jya, "
1235927,"And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? ","kabengbeng da so mata na a pacicin. Maniring sira am, ""Pancyan pala. Sino jyamen o yambakbak jimo ang."" "
1235928,And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.,Aro ciring da a ipeyleylak da sya.
1235929,"And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, ","Madagdag am meysinsinmo rana sira o kamanrarakehan da no tao do Yotay a meysirisiring nya.

1235930,"Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:","Maniring sira ji Yeso am, ""Pancyan pala jyamen. Manngwa, ka manoyong a si Kizisto an?"" Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Tana ipeypanci ko jinyo am jyabo kanoyong nyo jyaken a. "
1235931,"and if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.",No si myan so ipacici ko jinyo am jyabo kapasapa nyo jyaken a. 
1235932,Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.,"Am makeykai ko rana amlisna do wanan na ni Ama ta do to a ney mowyat na an."" "
1235933,"Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.","Maniring sira o aro a tao am, ""Anak na imo saon ni Ama ta do to?"" Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""O nipanci nyo rana am yamanoyong."" "
1235934,"And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.","Maniring sira am, ""Tana ji ta makakala so ciring a iraherahet ta sya am cyaha, ta ta na nimamizing o na iraherahet si Ama ta do to."""
1235935,"And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. ","Meyratateng am mamimin sira o tao a mangay ni Yeso do tangain na ni Pilato, "
1235936,"And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to C&#230; sar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. ","a kalavat da rana so iraherahet da sya.

1235937,"And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.","Maniring si Pilato ji Yeso am, ""Panirsirngen da imo no tao do Yotay?"" Maniring si Yeso am, ""Noon, manoyong ori."""
1235938,"Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. ","Meyratateng am ipanci na ni Pilato do panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano aro a tao. Maniring am, ""Ko ji makakala so yamakdeng a raraten no tao eya."" "
1235939,"And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. ","Am ikavevevek da amlololos no tao a manci no, ""Yanimangnanao ori do Yotay eya. Am na papwen do Cyadidi yana kangay nya do jya so na pasozisozyan so aro a tao."""

1235941,"And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.",Katenngan na si Yeso a nimapo do yaponged na ni Helote a ili am ori o nyangayan da nya ji Helote. No kano nang am amyan si Helote do Yelosaleng. 
1235942,"And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. ",Macita na ni Helote si Yeso am masaray. Ta nimamizing na rana o aro a vazay na ni Yeso. Am ori o nikakzeban na sya a citahen so mapangyangyalak a vazay na. 
1235943,Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. ,Am ori o nipacicyan na si Yeso no aro a ciriciring. Am abwata o asa ka ciring a nitovis na jya ni Yeso. 
1235944,And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. ,Sira rana o panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to am arakorako pa o patwawen da iraherahet da sya. 
1235945,"And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.","Am ori rana o nipeyyaliliman da jya ni Helote a kano aro a itaysang do dang. So nipeymetdehan da sya, kapayob da jya so akmey ayob no panirsirngen, kangay da rana nya ji Pilato. "
1235946,And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.,O araraw na no nang am niyapwan no kapeykagagan da ni Helote a kani Pilato. No kabo na pa no vazay ori am ji sira masyakan so kanekanen sira ang.
1235947,"And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, ",Nilovot na sira ni Pilato o panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan da tao a kano aro a tao. 
1235948,"said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: ","Maniring jira am, ""O nyo nyai jyaken a tao eya am yakmey yamapasozisozi so aro a tao.

1235949,"No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. ","Si Helote rana am akman sang, ta abo makala na raraten na. Am ori o nyayyan na nya do jya. So na ikabwata no raraten na a iwakwak ta sya. "
1235950,"I will therefore chastise him, and release him. ","Kapanci ko no tao a somipsipzot jya kapasaway ko rana sya."" "
1235951,(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) ,[Mangday no akman sang kapamaring da so kanen o kato na mangozayan do pamnekan da no tao a mapasaway so asa ka nipteng da tao.] 
1235952,"And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: ","Mamizing da no aro a tao o ciriciring na am ikavevek da amlololos a manci no, ""Zakaten nyo a kapasaway mo si Palapa a itoro mo jyamen."" "
1235953,"(who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) ",Si Palapa rana am mapasobsobna do seyvo a kapanwakwak na so tao. Am ori o niptengan da sya. 
1235954,"Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. ",Naknakmen na ni Pilato o kapasaway na si Yeso. Am ori o nipakekan na so aro a tao. 
1235955,"But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. ","Am ikavevevek da amlololos no aro a tao a manci no, ""Padketen do jyojika! Padketen do jyojika!"" "
1235956,"And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. ","Ipitlo na sira pacicin ni Pilato am ipanci na jira o, ""Ikeykongo raraten na no nya. Jyabo ko kapakakala so iwakwak ta sya raraten na.

1235957,"And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. ","Mamizing da no aro a tao am ikavevevek da amlololos a manci no, ""Padketen si Yeso do jyojika!"" Ji na pasovoy sira am to na rana ngonoci sira, "
1235958,And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. ,kapangozay na ni Pilato do mina ciring da jya no aro a tao. 
1235959,"And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.",Meyratateng am pasawain na si Palapa a nipteng da nimapasobsobna do seyvo a nimanwakwak so tao a katoro na ni Yeso jira a peyyaliliman da.
1235960,"And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.",Yangay da si Yeso no itaysang no Loma am masinmo da o asa ka tao do Cidinay a meyngaran si Simong a omalam a omoli a apo do takey a karakep da sya a pahanhanen da a somabway no jyojika kapacilolo na ji Yeso. 
1235961,"And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. ",O macilolo ji Yeso a aro a tao am amyan so aro a mavakes a ji ngoring amlavi jya. 
1235962,"But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.","Meyvazingowngaw si Yeso am ipanci na jira.

1235963,"For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.","Ta makeykai rana o kasasnad no araraw no arako a alalaw nyo.

1235976,"And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. ","Meyratateng am maniring ori ji Yeso am, ""Mo Yeso, no si ipirwa ka mai a meypanirsirngen am manakem mo yaken an."" "

1235984,"And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just: (the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimath&#230; a, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. ",Amyan so asa ka tao a meyngaran si Yoseyvo a tao do Yotay a meyvahay do ili a meyngaran so Adimatay.

1235985,"This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. ",Mangay ori a macisirsiring ji Pilato so kakas na so kataotao na ni Yeso. 
1235986,"And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. ",Meyratateng am mangay na rana pakasen o kataotao na ni Yeso do jyojika a kapongos na jya no milakayob a yangay do nidokdokan na rana rako a mao. Am abo pa do dang o nimrakeh a tao a. 
1235987,"And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. ",O araraw na no nang am ikalima na zezak a ipeypanam na no kapeywalam no tao. 
1235988,"And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. ",O nimapo do Cyadidi a nimacihza ji Yeso a mavavakes am macilolo sira ji Yoseyvo a mangay tomita so nipakakasan na sya. 
1235989,"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.",Omoli sira do vahay da am mapeysinsinmo sira so mahangno a haneng a kato da mangozayan do iwawalam da a meywalam do ipeyweywalam no tao.
1235990,"Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. ",Madagdag do niciyo am palolwen da na no mavavakes ang o nipeysinsinmo da mahangno a haneng a mangay do nipakakasan da si Yeso. 
1235991,And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. ,Makaranes sira am to da cita o rako a vato a aneb na a nimalolog. 
1235992,"And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. ",Somdep sira am abo rana o kataotao ni Yeso. 
1235993,"And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: ",Naknakmen da o akman sang a vazay am to ngyan so rarwa ka tinsi a maniray so ayob a meytatanek do katangked da. 
1235994,"and as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? ","So nikanyahey da ambengbeng so moing da. Maniring o rarwa ka tinsi jira am, ""Ikongo nyo ipeykala so mavyay a tao do yanan no nimawakwak a tao. "
1235995,"He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, ","Yaji ngyan do jya, ta yana nimavyay. Naknakmen nyo an o mina ciring na jinyo do Cyadidi an. Ta maniring asyo am, "
1235996,"saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. ","'Iya rana am itoro da do lima no ji manaralay a tao a kapadket da sya do jyojika a kavyay na rana do ikatlo na araw.'"" "
1235997,"And they remembered his words, ","Am ori o nipakanakman da rana sya no mavavakes so mina ciring na ni Yeso, "
1235998,"and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. ",a kakaro da rana do dang a mangay manci nya do asa so ikakarwan a macinanao ji Yeso a kano aro a tao so nimacita da vazay. 
1235999,"It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. ",O ngarangaran da no mavavakes am Matelyan Madiya kani Yeanna kano ina na ni Yake a meyngaran si Madiya kano karwan da mavakes. 
1236000,"And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. ","Am o mina ciring da jira no mavavakes am ji da nganoyngi no nipamnekan na ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na, ta ala da to ngamaoga a ciring, kwan da. "
1236001,"Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.",Si Pite am mina to malalayo a mangay do nipakakasan da sya a kapeylologod na tomita sya. Am o nivaovaod da rana sya milakayob o nimacita na. Am ori o nioli na a somavasavak no nimacita na vazay.
1236002,"And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. ",Do araraw no kano nang am amyan so rarwa ka tao a meypangay do asa ka ili. O ngaran no ili ori am Imao. O karairai na no ili ori do Yelosaleng am atlo a ka vatvatek o yalam sya. 
1236003,And they talked together of all these things which had happened. ,Sira rana ori do nyalaman da am malavat da o mina vazay do araraw no nang. 
1236004,"And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. ",Kapyahen da meysirisiring am macisngen si Yeso jira a kapacihza na jira omalam. 
1236005,But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.,Macita da si Yeso am ji da na tovili. 
1236006,"And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?","Maniring jira am, ""Ikongo nyo malavat ang."" Mamizing da am mina to neyked sira a marahet nya so onowned. "
1236007,"And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? ","O asa ka tao jira meyngaran so Kelopa a mapacici si Yeso. Maniring am, ""Manngwa, mo pa jya nimamizing o vazay do Yelosaleng a yamiseysan do dang?"" "
1236008,"And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: ","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Ikongo a vazay."" Maniring sira am, ""Vazay na ni Yeso a tao do Nasale. Iya rana am panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to, tey mowyat so ciriciring do tangain ni Ama ta do to a kano aro a tao. "
1236009,"and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. ",Iya rana ori am da todey ngapa no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem ta si Ama ta do to a kano aro a panipanirsirngen a wakwaken a kapadket da rana sya do jyojika. 
1236010,"But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. ","Namen nipanci ya a nimai a mapatastas so Isedi a tao. Am yajyakman sang, ta ikatlo na araw ya no akman sang a vazay. "
1236011,"Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; ","Da nipaogto yamen no yamakanateng a mavavakes, ta sira niomhep a yanimangay do nipakakasan da sya. "
1236012,"and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. ","Am yada jya nimacita do dang o kataotao na. Am ori o da nipeysinaoli a manci no, 'Yamyan so namen nimacita a tinsi, na kapanci nya jyamen so na kanimavyay rana ni Yeso.' "
1236013,"And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.","Yamangay sira o karwan jyamen do nipakakasan da sya a tomita sya am yajyalas o ciring da no mavavakes, ta yabo rana si Yeso."" "
1236014,"Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Manoyong kamo a yajyateteneng a tao an. Ta ikongo nyo ji nganoyngi do ciring da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to no kakwa. "
1236015,"ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?","Manngwa, nyo jyatenngi o kangay no akman sang a alalaw no Misayya a kai na rana no azwazway na?"" "
1236016,"And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. ",Meyratateng am pangozayan na o nivatvatkan ni Moyse a kano panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a kaononong na rana do mina ciring da sya do Seysyo a omagaz do kataotao na.
1236017,"And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. ",Masngen rana kapakaranes da do angayan da a ili am to mangonong pa si Yeso. 
1236018,"But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.","Meyratateng am ipanci da si Yeso a macisan jira, ta makeykai rana o kahep na. Am ori o nionotan na jira ni Yeso. "
1236019,"And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. ",Amhezsad a macihanghang jira si Yeso am ahapen na o myanpaw kasaray na nya ji Ama ta do to a kapeyketeb na sya a itoro na jira. 
1236020,"And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. ",Meyratateng am mina todeywangi o mata da. Am ori o nipakasingkadan da ji Yeso. Am todabo rana si Yeso. 
1236021,"And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?","Maniring sira do kadwan jira am, ""Yanimacisirsiring jyaten do ta pangonongan a na kapangononong jyaten so Seysyo no kano nang am ta mina todeyrasi so onowned a yamasaray a omamizing sya!"""
1236022,"And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, ","So nikakeykai da nimeysinaoli do Yelosaleng. Makaranes sira do dang am macita da o asa so ikakarwan a macinanao ji Yeso a kano aro a kararay da a malovot do dang, "
1236023,"saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. ",a makalavat so kanoyong ni Yeso a nimeyvangon rana a kanimapacita na rana ji Simong. 
1236024,"And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.",O rarwa ori am malavat da o mina vazay da do rarahan no kapeypangay da do Imao a kapakalavat da so kanimapeyketeb na ni Yeso so myanpaw a itoro na jira. Am ori o nipakatovilan da rana jya. Ori o mina ciring da do aro a tao no rarwa ori.
1236025,"And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.","Malavat da o aro a vazay am to meytatanek si Yeso do tangain da a manci nya jira so, ""Kokay kamo."" "
1236026,"But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. ",Am ori o niogtwan da nya a mapatolin sya do anito. 
1236027,"And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Ikongo nyo ikanyahey a ji meyhanhan nyaken. "
1236028,"Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.","Cittey kamo o lima ko a kano ai ko so ika yaken na. Beken a kadwan. Pinaney kamo yaken. Ori o ipakateneng nyo jya, ta ji sira meyyasisi. Ji sira meytotowang o anito. Cittey kamo. Ta yamyan so asisi ko a kano totowang ko!"" "
1236029,"And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.",Meyratateng am ipacita na jira o lima na kano ai na. 
1236030,"And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?","Am katenngan da o kasaray da am ipeyzokab da. Am ori o ji da pa nganoyngi jya. So peycirngan na jira so, ""Yamyan so kanen nyo do jya?"" "
1236031,"And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. ",Meyratateng am mangap sira so asa cilad a nisazaban a among a patodahen jya. 
1236032,"And he took it, and did eat before them.",Todahen na jira kakan na rana sya do tangain da.
1236033,"And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.","Meyratateng am maniring jira si Yeso am, ""O aro a vazay rana ya am nimalavat ko na jinyo no kakwa pa. O nivatvatkan ni Moyse a kano panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a kano nivatvatkan a Anwanood a yaomagaz jyaken am yarana nimangononong."" "
1236034,"Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, ",Ori o icyakma dey mababa so nakenakem. So ipakateneng da do Ciriciring no Seysyo. 
1236035,"and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:","Maniring pa jira am, ""O nivatvatkan da do Seysyo a ciriciring am amyan so alalaw ni Kizisto. Ikatlo na araw am mirwa pa mavyay. "
1236036,"and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.",Am ori o papwen sya do Yelosaleng a meylimwang no mamlis a kano manvonas so raraten a ciriciring a kangay na do peycyamahamahatawan na. 
1236037,And ye are witnesses of these things.,"Inyo o yongkad no vazay ko a nidomket do Seysyo, do mina kapakacita nyo so akman sya a vazay a nimangononong rana. "
1236038,"And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.","Tovoin ko jinyo o Seyzi a nipanci na a itoro na jinyo ni Ama. Am to kamo ngyan do ili eya amnanala sya mangay no si parawaten na jinyo o oyowyat apo do teyngato."""
1236039,"And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. ",Meyratateng am palolwen na sira ni Yeso a mangay do meyngaran so Potani a ili. Amyan sira do dang am ipanlanlag na sira no lima na. 
1236040,"And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. ",Ipanlanlag na sira am karwan na rana sira a meycyakavat a mangay do teyngato. 
1236041,"And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: ",Ori o niraralayan da nya masasaray so onowned a meysinaoli do Yelosaleng. 
1236042,"and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.",So nikasangib da rana do rako a panaralayan a omazwazway si Ama ta do to.
1236043,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. ",No kaji na pa amaogan no karawan am amyan rana o Ciring ni Ama ta do to. O Ciring rana am macilovot ji Ama ta do to. O Ciring am manoyong a Tao do to. 
1236044,The same was in the beginning with God. ,Nimakalapo no kakwa o kapacilovot no Ciring eya ji Ama ta do to. 
1236045,All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. ,Ciring o nyamaog na ni Ama ta do to so makakaday. So ikabo no asa ka maoran no karawan a ji na nyamaog no Ciring eya. 
1236046,In him was life; and the life was the light of men. ,O Ciring ni Ama ta do to am ori o yapwan no inawan no tao. O inawan rana am zezngang a ikavyay no tao. 
1236047,And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.,O zezak am cirain na o kasarisaryan. So ji na makahespi so mazngang no masari.
1236048,"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. ",O meyngaran so Yowani a tao am nitovoy na ni Ama ta do to a lamlamsoy na. 
1236049,"The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. ",Iya rana am ipanci na do tao o zezngang a kamimin no tao a makamizing sya kapanganoyong da rana. 
1236050,"He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. ","Am beken a iya ori o zezak ang, ta o kapangnanao na no zezak ang. "
1236051,"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. ",O zezak rana am manoyong a zezngang apo do teyngato a tomiray so tao do karawan.
1236052,"He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. ",O Ciring rana am amyan rana do karawan a nipangamaog na ni Ama ta do to so karawan. Am kaji da makatenngan jya no tao do karawan. 
1236053,"He came unto his own, and his own received him not. ",Mangay do pacikeylyan na am to da nazibwan no tao do dang. 
1236054,"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: ",Sira rana ji nazibo nya tao a kano omanoyong jya tao am abneken na sira akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to. 
1236055,"which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. ","Am beken a meyngongyod sira ori a nimapodpod so kataotao ji Ama ta do to, ta omaing do kanoyong da ji Ama ta do to. Am ori o abnekan na sira akma ney anak."
1236056,"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, ) full of grace and truth.",So nipeyvaliw no Ciring a tao a macikaop jyaten a tey rako so pangangarilawan a tey manoyong. So nipakacittan namen rana so azwazway na. So ikanoyong na abo so ikararwa angayan no azwazway. Ta iya rana am veyvowen na Anak ni Ama ta do to.
1236057,"John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. ","Iya o ipeylimwang ni Yowani amlololos a manci no, ""Iya o nimalavat ko na a manownowji pa a mai a ka nyaken. Am mahamahama pa ori ka nyaken. Ta amyan rana no kaji ko pa tazakan do karawan."""
1236058,"And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. ",Yateywara o pangangarilawan na a na itoro jyaten. O aryarilaw na jyaten am yabo yakasaraw a na ipeywalam. 
1236059,"For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. ",O iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to o nipangnanao na ni Moyse a onotan ta. Am o pangangarilawan na kano manoyong a nanao na ni Ama ta do to am ori o nyai na ni Yeso Kizisto do tao do karawan. 
1236060,"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.",Abo pa o tao a nimakacita si Ama ta do to. O Anak na yamacikto ji Ama ta do to a yamlisna do katangked na am ori o nipakateneng ta ji Ama ta do to.
1236061,"And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? ","No kano nang am o meynakem a tao do Yotay do Yelosaleng am nimanovoy sira so mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano Diwey a tao a mangay a tomita si Yowani.

1236062,"And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. ","Maniring jira am, ""To ko na macitangayan jinyo am beken a Misayya ko."" "
1236063,"And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. ","Maniring sira am, ""Si Idiya ka ya an?""

1236064,"Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? ","Maniring pa sira am, ""Pancyan pa jyamen, sino ka. Ta itovis namen do yanimapahanhan jyamen. Pancyan pala wanjin mo kapwan."" "
1236065,"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.","Maniring si Yowani am, ""Yaken o nipanci ni Isayya a omlololos do kabwan no nihakawan no tao. Ta maniring am, 'Ipeywadwad nyo o Panirsirngen so rarahan na.'"""
1236066,And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. ,Karahan am pacicin da pa si Yowani no nitovoy da no tao a macyagom do Vadisay. 
1236067,"And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet? ","Maniring sira am, ""Beken a Misayya ka? Beken a si Idiya ka? Beken a panoyonoywan na imo so ciring ni Ama ta do to? Am ikongo mo ipanaktak so tao."" "
1236068,"John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; ","Maniring si Yowani am, ""Yako manaktak no ranom. Am amyan so asa ka tao a yamacikaop jinyo a yanyo jyatenngi. "
1236069,"he it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. ","Iya rana am manownowji pa a mai ka nyaken. Am tana manownowji pa mai ka nyaken am yabo pacicingayan ko jya."""
1236070,"These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.",O vazay rana ya am no keyyan da do katovangan no Yotan a ayo a ili da do Potani. Do dang rana am nipanaktakan ni Yowani.
1236071,"The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. ","Ikadwa na araw am macita ni Yowani si Yeso a mai. Maniring si Yowani am, ""Oya rana am akmey kagling a nitovoy na ni Ama ta do to a omahap so tao do peyraratenan da. "
1236072,"This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. ",Iya rana ya am nipanci ko rana jinyo a manownowji a mai. Am arakorako pa oyowyat na ka nyaken. Ta ji ko pa nimatazak a tao am amyan rana. 
1236073,"And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. ","No kakwa am ji ko pa tenngi ori. O yako ipanaktak no ranom sicyaikwaya am ko panopen sira o Isedi a tao a kapakateneng da na jya."""
1236074,"And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. ","Maniring pa si Yowani am, ""Ko nimacita o Seyzi a yakmey hato a yameyhekas do teyrahem a yamangay someyked do kataotao na. "
1236075,"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. ","Ji ko a tenngi no kakwa o nitovoy na ni Ama ta do to.

1236076,"And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.","Ko na nimacita. Am ori o ko pancyan nya jinyo o na kanoyong a Anak na ni Ama ta do to."""
1236077,"Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; ",Ikadwa na araw am mirwa pa mangay si Yowani a kano rarwa ka macinanao jya. 
1236078,"and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! ","Macita na si Yeso a meyhatay am maniring si Yowani am, ""Iya rana am akmey kagling ni Ama ta do to."" "
1236079,"And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. ",Mamizing da o ciring eya no rarwa ka macinanao ji Yowani am to sira na macihza ji Yeso. 
1236080,"Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master, ) where dwellest thou? ","Meyvazingowngaw si Yeso am to na cita o rarwa ka tao a macilolo jya. Maniring jira am, ""Ikongo nyo kakzeben."" Maniring sira am, ""Do wanjin o vahay mo, mo Lapi.""

1236082,"One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. ",O rarwa nimacihza ji Yeso a tao am asa ka tao o kakteh na ni Simong Pite a meyngaran si Antele. 
1236083,"He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. ","So nyangay na ni Antele a mangay komala si Simong. Maniring jya am, ""Ko na nimacita o Misayya."" (O peypeypangayan no Misayya am Kizisto.)"
1236084,"And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.","Makarahan am yangay na si Simong ji Yeso.

1236085,"The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.","Ikadwa na araw am naknakmen na ni Yeso o kangay na do Cyadidi. Meyratateng am to na sazi si Veydipo. Maniring jya am, ""Macihza ka jyaken."" "
1236086,"Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.",Si Veydipo rana am meyvahay do Peysayta. Macikeylyan ji Antele a kani Pite.

1236088,"And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. ","Maniring si Natannay am, ""Sino ipanci a kato na ngyanan no meynakem a tao do Nasale."" Maniring si Veydipo am, ""Sijya, kacita mo sya."""
1236089,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!","Macita ni Yeso si Natannay mangay jya am maniring jya am, ""Yameysinogat ori a Isedi a tao. Yabo do onowned na o yamalahet."" "
1236090,"Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me?

Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""No kaji na pa mancyan nimo ni Veydipo am ko na nimacita imo a yamyan do teyrahem no ovako a kayo."" "
1236091,"Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.","Maniring si Natannay am, ""Mo Mangnanao, ka manoyong a Anak ni Ama ta do to a Panirsirngen no Isedi a tao."" "
1236092,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""O mo anoyngan jyaken am ko nipanci jimo no kapakacita ko jimo no keyyan mo pa do teyrahem no ovako a kayo?

1236093,"And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.","Maniring pa jira si Yeso am, ""To ko na macitangayan jinyo am macita nyo na o teyngato a kacyangan a kapakacita nyo na so aro a tinsi ni Ama ta do to a meygegcin jyaken a Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a meysisinaoli sira do teyngato."""
1236094,And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: ,Ikadwa na araw am amyan do Cyadidi do meyngaran so Cyana a ili so tao a meysinmo. Amyan dang o ina na ni Yeso. 
1236095,"and both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. ",Si Yeso rana kano macinanao jya am nipanoyon da sira no matarek so vahay a tao. Am ori o nyangay da. 
1236096,"And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. ","Ikongo do nimagid rana o yopen da potaw cyo, am ori o nipancyan na ni ina na ji Yeso so, ""Apya sira ito a yabo rana so yopen."" "

1236098,"His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. ","Maniring o ina na do lamlamsoy no meysinmo a tao am, ""To nyo ngamiznga o pahanhanan na jinyo."""
1236099,"And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. ",Amyan dang so anem a peraranom.

1236102,"When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, ",Tahaman no meymatmatngeh nya tao o nipeyvaliw na ni Yeso a potaw cyo am isavasavak na o nyahapan da sya.

1236107,"and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: ",Do livolivon no rako a panaralayan da am makacita so tao a manazang no baka kano kagling a kano hato a kano aro a tao a amlisna dang a mamalit so nizpi. 
1236108,"and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; ","Karahan am mangap si Yeso so kolili a kapaksoz na so baka kano kagling do rako a panaralayan a powboten, a kapasakeb na so pamalimalitan da no tao so nizpi a kavangan, a kapeyvwak no nizpi do teyrahem.

1236113,"Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? ","Maniring sira am, ""Yanem o ikasikalima na (46) kawan no nipatnek so rako a panaralayan am ikongo mo pancyan no kapakatlo mo a araw a mapatanek sya."" "
1236114,But he spake of the temple of his body. ,Am o paingan ni Yeso so ciring na am kataotao na. 
1236115,"When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.",Mirwa mavyay si Yeso am manakem da na no macinanao jya o mina ciring na.

1236116,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.

1236117,"But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, ","Am ji na meyhanhanan sira ni Yeso, ta katenngan na o kalas no onowned da. "
1236118,and needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.,Tana ji da mancyan no tao ji Yeso o aktokto da am to na rana tenngi ni Yeso o onowned da.
1236119,"There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: ",Amyan so asa ka tao a macyagom do Vadisay a meyngaran so Niketemo a panirsirngen no tao do Yotay. 
1236120,"the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. ","Ipisa kahep na am mangay ji Yeso. Maniring jya am, ""Mo Mangnanao, namen katenngan imo a mangnanao a nitovoy ni Ama ta do to a yamangnanao so tao.

1236121,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""To ko na macitangayan jimo am no si ji mirwa a matazak a tao o tao am ji macikaop do italamozong na ni Ama ta do to a tao."""

1236123,"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""To ko na macitangayan jimo am no jya nimalikey o tao do ranom a kano Seyzi am ji macikaop do italamozong na tao ni Ama ta do to.

1236127,"Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? ","Maniring si Niketemo am, ""Ta to na akmani so sang!"" "
1236128,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Imo am ka mangnanao do Isedi a tao. Manngwa, tolang ori a ji mo a tenngi a vazay? "
1236129,"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.",To ko na macitangayan jimo am o namen katenngan a kano namen nimacita o namen patwawen. Am yanyo ji ngapa o yakman sang a yanamen patwawen.

1236132,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:","Maniring pa si Yeso am, ""No kakwa pa am nimapatnek si Moyse do kayo so nipariparing da mavowaw do kabwan no nihakawan no tao.

1236133,"that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.",So ikamimin no omanoyong jyaken a tao a makahap so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da. 
1236134,"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.","Yatey rako na karilawan no tao do karawan ni Ama ta do to.

1236135,For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.,Ta o nitovoyan na so Anak na do teyrahem am beken a pasingsingtan na o tao do teyrahem. Ta patazadangen na sira do teyngato.
1236136,"He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.","""Omanoyong do Anak ni Ama ta do to a tao am ji na mancyan sira meyraraten.

1236137,"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.","O Anak ni Ama ta do to am akmey zezak a nimai do teyrahem a amzezak so tao do karawan.

1236138,"For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.","O meyraraten a tao am ikaoya da o mazngang. Am ori o ji da macisngeni do kazngangan, ta ikanyahey da o kapakateneng da jira meyraraten. "

1236140,"After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Jud&#230; a; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. ",Mavitos ori am meypangay si Yeso a kano macinanao jya do Yotay. So niseysan da dang so makanateng so araraw a manaktak so tao.

1236142,For John was not yet cast into prison.,No kano nang am ji da pa nipteng si Yowani.

1236155,"When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, ",Mamizing da no tao a macyagom do Vadisay si Yeso a manara so macilocilolo jya a kapakamizing da sya arwaro pa so nitaktakan a kani Yowani.

1236182,"The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, ",Iptad na no mavakes o peraranom na kangay na rana do ili a manci nya do aro a tao. 
1236183,"Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? ","Maniring am, ""Citahey kamo o yasa ka tao a yato mimin so mina vazay ko a yapatwawen. Ala Misayya o ito."" "
1236184,"Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.",Karahan am karwan da o ili da no aro a tao a mangay tomita si Yeso.
1236185,"In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. ",Meyratateng am gacigatan da si Yeso no macinanao jya a omoran do velek na. 
1236186,"But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Yana myan so kanen ko, am nyo jyatenngi ori."" "
1236187,"Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? ","Maniring sira do ipeykalakalavaten da am, ""Ala yamyan so tao a yanimanta nya so kanen na an?"" "
1236188,"Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""O kanen ko am onotan ko a pakavosen o vazay no yanitomovoy jyaken. "

1236194,"So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. ",Macita da no aro a tao do Samadiya si Yeso am gacigatan da macisan jira. Ori o nisan na dang so kadwa araw. 
1236195,And many more believed because of his own word; ,Nikarapan o tao a omanoyong do nanao na ni Yeso. 
1236196,"and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.","Ta maniring sira do mavakes am, ""Beken a ciring mo an o namen ipanganoyong rana sicyaikwaya.

1236197,"Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. ",Kadwa araw si Yeso a nimisan dang a kangay na rana do Cyadidi. 
1236198,"For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. ",Nipanci na rana ni Yeso no kakwa o kaji da panadnadan so panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to no macikeylyan jya. 
1236199,"Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galil&#230; ans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.",Am makaranes si Yeso do Cyadidi am aro tao a somaray nya. Ta no kangay da do Yelosaleng a macipamaring so kanen do Iyeci am nimacita da o vazay na.
1236200,"So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. ",Meysinaoli si Yeso do Cyana a macinapnap do Cyadidi. Do dang rana am nipeyvaliw na so ranom a potaw cyo. Am amyan so asa ka meynakem a tao. O anak no nang am meyngen do Cyapaynong. 
1236201,"When he heard that Jesus was come out of Jud&#230; a into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. ",Mamizing na si Yeso a nimakaranes rana do Cyadidi apo do Yotay am mangay ji Yeso a manci nya a mangay do Cyapaynong a omiwakwak do anak na a toda jyangangay so inawan. 
1236202,"Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""No si macita nyo o vazay a yongkad no kayapo ko ji Ama ta do to am, ori o ipanganoyong nyo."" "
1236203,"The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. ","Maniring o meynakem a tao ori am, ""Mo kahakay, macihza ka pa jyaken do yana ikavyay pa no anak ko."" "
1236204,"Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. ","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""Angay rana. Ta yarana nimapya o anak mo."" So nyanoyngan na rana no tao ang do ciring ni Yeso a mangay rana."
1236205,"And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. ","Amyan pa do rarahan am masinmo na rana o lamlamsoy na. Maniring sira do meynakem a tao am, ""Yapya rana o anak mo."" "
1236206,"Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. ","Karahan am pacicin na sira. Maniring am, ""No kango o kapya na no anak ko."" Maniring sira am, ""Ikasa na vatvatek no kakyab do makoyab am nimacipinda dang o kaji na rana paingwatan sya."" "
1236207,"So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. ","Naknakmen na am todey meyyangay o cinapya na no kapacisirsiring na jya. Ta maniring si Yeso jya no kano nang am, ""Yapya rana o anak mo."" Am ori o nipacipindan no kanoyong da na jya nira ori a asa ka vahay. "
1236208,"This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Jud&#230; a into Galilee.",O vazay rana ori am ikadwa na no vazay ni Yeso do Cyadidi no kapo na do Yotay a yongkad no kayapo na ji Ama ta do to.
1236209,After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. ,Makanateng so araraw am macinao do pamarmarngan da so kanen no tao do Yotay o yangay na ni Yeso do Yelosaleng. 
1236210,"Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. ",Amyan do Yelosaleng so ngaranan da Pazezevngen no kagling. Am amyan do siri na so meybebneng a ranom. O ingaran da jya no Sipolay a tao am Peyseta. O livolivon no meybebneng a ranom am meykalima o tezantehed do dang. 
1236211,"In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. ",O tezantehed rana ori am meycyeyreyray sira dang o meykeyngeyngen a tao. Sira rana ori am amyan jira ang so mavota kano ji makakalam a kano ji makapeygonagonay a tao. [Sira rana ori am panalahen da o kapeygonagonay no ranom. 
1236212,"For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. ",Ta o tinsi ni Ama ta do to am mangay na gonagonain o ranom ang. Anoyngan da o kato na rana apyan no ingingnen no ney manma a somivoz do ranom ang.]
1236213,"And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. ",Amyan dang so asa ka tao a nimeyngen so wao so ikasikapat (38) so awawan. 
1236214,"When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?","Macita na ori ni Yeso a ji meyvangon am katenngan na o kownay na rana nimeyngen. Maniring jya am, ""Kokay. Mo ikakza o kavonas rana no ingingnen mo an?"" "
1236215,"The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. ","Maniring o meyngen a tao ori am, ""Mo kahakay, no kapeygonagonay no ranom am yabo yamarilaw nyaken a yamapangay jyaken do ranom.

1236216,"Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""Tanek rana kahap mo na so atpil mo a omalam."" "
1236217,"And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.","Makarahan am jya nimeyyahahay a mapya o tao ang, kahap na rana so atpil na omalam rana. No kanang am nimacinao do araraw no ipeywalam no tao. "
1236218,"The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. ","Maniring sira o panipanirsirngen no tao do Yotay do nimapya rana tao ori am, ""Sicyaraw eya am ipeywalam no tao. So ji mo ngapi so atpil mo."" "
1236219,"He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. ","Maniring am, ""Yamaniring jyaken o tao a niomiwakwak jyaken am, 'Ahap rana o atpil mo a kangay mo rana.'"" "
1236220,"Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? ","Maniring sira am, ""Sino o yanimanci nimo a yamahap so atpil a mangay rana."" "
1236221,"And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. ",Am ji na tenngi no nimapya rana a tao ang o niomiwakwak jya. Ta nikarwan na rana sira o aro a tao do dang ni Yeso. 
1236222,"Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.","Mownay am masinmo ni Yeso o tao a nikeywakwakan rana do rako a panaralayan. Maniring jya am, ""Yaka na manoyong a yapya rana. Ji mo na peyneynama o kapeyraraten mo. Ta arakorako pa o alalaw a mangay jimo."" "
1236223,"The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. ",Karahan am mangay rana o tao ori a manci nya do tao do Yotay o mina keywakwak na jya ni Yeso. 
1236224,"And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.",Nimacipinda no kano nang o kapacioya da rana ji Yeso do kato na mangiwakwakan do ipeyweywalam no tao. 
1236225,"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Yato meyvazay si Ama. So ko to nginarai sya."" "
1236226,"Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. ","To da na mamneki no tao do Yotay o kawakwak da si Yeso do kapakamizing da so ciring na. Ta ji na ngahapa o icicirawat da, do kaji meyvazayan do ipeyweywalam no tao. Maciyoman pa o kapakamizing da so ciring na manci no kapeyyama na si Ama ta do to a mapakto so kataotao na ji Ama ta do to."
1236227,"Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.","Maniring pa jira si Yeso am, ""To ko na macitangayan jinyo am no ko to mangozai o kataotao ko am abo mahap ko a vazay.

1236228,"For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.","Am yatey rako o aryarilaw na jyaken ni Ama. Yana mamimin o vazay na yana nipacita jyaken, mangay katoro na nya jyaken so arakorako pa vazay a isavasavak nyo. "

1236234,For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;,Si Ama ta do to o yapwan no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad no tao. So icyakman na sang no Anak na.

",Karahan am peykakasahen da na o atda da do alima ka myanpaw ang. Peysinsinmowen da o ji da nimimina am nipno da o adwa so ikarwa a yala. 
1236269,"Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.","Macita da o mina vazay ni Yeso a yongkad no kayapo na ji Ama ta do to am maniring sira am, ""Oya saon o da ipanci a yamai do teyrahem a panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to."""
1236270,"When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. ",Katenngan na ni Yeso sira toda ji ngamaog sya a panirsirngen da. Am ori o nikaveyvow na nimangay do tokon a tomayo nira.
1236271,"And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, ","Maseyrem rana am mangay sira o macinanao jya do rako a meybebneng a ranom, "
1236272,"and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. ",a kasakay da do tataloran a mangay do katovangan na ili a meyngaran so Cyapaynong. Mahep rana no kano nang am ji pa nimakaranes si Yeso jira. 
1236273,And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. ,Makarahan am to na nangsangan. To rana maciralay o paopaong na. 
1236274,"So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid. ",Amyan sira do karakwan no rako a meybebneng a ranom a mangaod o macinanao jya am macita da si Yeso a omalam do ranom a meypasngen jira. Macita da am manyahey sira.

1236276,Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.,Karahan am masaray sira mapazagpit si Yeso do tataloran da. So ji da nimeyyahahai a makaranes do angayan da hevek.
1236277,"The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; ",Ikadwa na araw am katenngan da no aro a tao si Yeso a jya nimacihza do macinanao jya.

1236279,"when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.",Katenngan da no aro a tao o kabo ni Yeso a kano macinanao jya am mavang sira do tataloran a mangay do Cyapaynong a komala sya.
1236280,"And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? ","Makala da si Yeso no aro a tao do katovangan no rako a meybebneng a ranom am maniring sira jya am, ""Mo Mangnanao, no kango kai mo do jya."" "
1236281,"Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""To ko na macitangayan jinyo am o nyo kalan jyaken am beken a nyo kanimakacita so ko nipatwaw a yongkad do kanimapo ko ji Ama ta do to an.

1236456,"But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. ",Sira rana aro a tao do Yotay am ji da nganoyngi o kanimavota no tao ang. Ipanci da o inyapwan na. 
1236457,"And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? ","Maniring sira am, ""Anak nyo ya? Manngwa, nimeycicinda o anak nyo ya nimavota? Ikongo na to makacitai rana sicyaikwaya."" "
1236458,"His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: ","Maniring o inyapwan na am, ""Yamanoyong a anak namen. Iya rana am nimakalapo no kalyalikey na o kaji na makacittan. So namen ipakateneng jya. "

1236460,"These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. ","O pancyan da no akman sang no inyapwan na am ikanyahey da o panipanirsirngen da no tao do Yotay.

1236461,"Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.",Ori o to da rana mancii nira no inyapwan na mangay mapacici so anak da.
1236462,"Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. ","Karahan am ipirwa sira mangay manci no nimapya so mata tao ang.

1236463,"He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. ","Maniring o nimavota tao ori am, ""Ko jyatenngi na kapeyraraten a tao. Am ko katenngan o kanimavota ko am ko na makacita sicyaikwaya."" "
1236464,"Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? ","Maniring sira jya am, ""Ikongo na mina vazay jimo. Yanimakongo so wanjin a yaniomiwakwak do mata mo."" "
1236465,"He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?

1236467,"We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. ","Namen katenngan o kanimacisirsiring ni Ama ta do to ji Moyse. Am o tao ori am tamo jyatenngi o na nikapwan."" "
1236468,"The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. ","Maniring ori am, ""Asyo ori nyo jyatenngi na kapwan no yaniomiwakwak do mata ko ang. "
1236469,"Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. ",Tamo katenngan o kaji na ngamizngan so pasyasyan da ji Ama ta do to no meyraraten a tao. Ta omraralay nya kano mahap so apyahen na vazay o amizngen na.

1236472,"They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. ","Karahan am ioya da o tao ang. Maniring sira jya am, ""Si mangnanao ka yameyraraten eya am makongo."" Karahan am pagcinen da do peyneynozyan da."
1236473,"Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?","Mamizing ni Yeso sira nimapagcin sya do peyneynozyan am mangay na kalahen.

1236474,"He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? ","Maniring am, ""Pancyaney jyaken. Sino o tao ang. Ta anoyngan ko."" "
1236475,"And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.","Maniring jya si Yeso am, ""Mo rana nimacita. O yamacisirsiring jimo am iya ori."" "
1236476,"And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.","Maniring am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, ko anoyngan imo."" Karahan am meylilitod do tangain ni Yeso a omraralay nya. "
1236477,"And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""O peypeypangayan no yako nyai do teyrahem am ko mapeykapyapinpin so tao.

1236478,"And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? ","Mamizing da o ciring eya no amyan dang a tao a macyagom do Vadisay am pacicin da si Yeso. Maniring sira am, ""Manngwa, mo patpehen yamen do mavota tao?"" "
1236479,"Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""No kamo manoyong a makateneng do na kakmey mavota no pahad nyo am abo raraten nyo.

1236497,There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. ,Mamizing da o aro a ciring ori no tao do Yotay am meyhatay sira so onowned a ji macipaswasovoy.

1236517,"Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, ",Makarahan am naknakmen da o karakep da sya am kanikomaro na rana jira.

1236531,"These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.","Iptad na o ciring na ni Yeso am maniring pa am, ""Yamitkeh si Lasalo a kagagan ta. Mangay ko pa yokain."" "
1236532,"Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. ","Maniring o macinanao jya am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, no si manoyong a mitkeh am ji meyvangon pa ori a."" "
1236533,Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. ,O peypeypangayan no ciring ni Yeso am yarana nimawakwak si Lasalo. Am ji da tenngi no tao o ciring na. Ta ipanci da yato ngitkeh.

1236536,"Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. ","O meyngaran so Tomase a ngaranan da si Nimeytovong a nimatazak a tao am maniring do karwan da macinanao ji Yeso am, ""Macihza tamo jya, kapacikawakwak ta jya."""

1236543,"Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.","Maniring jya si Yeso am, ""O kakteh mo ori am mirwa pa ori a mavyay."" "
1236544,"Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. ","Maniring si Marta am, ""Ko katenngan o keypirwa na mavyay no marateng o araraw no keypirwa da meyvangon no nimawakwak rana tao do ikavos rana no karawan."" "
1236545,"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Yaken o mapeyvangon so nimawakwak a tao.

1236547,"She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. ","Maniring si Marta am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, ko anoyngan. Ko anoyngan imo a Misayya a mai do karawan a Anak na ni Ama ta do to."""
1236548,"And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. ","Teyka na o ciring na ni Marta am mangay rana do vahay da a kahes na si Madiya. Maniring am, ""Yana nimai o Mangnanao. Yana ipanci imo."" "
1236549,"As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. ",Mamizing na o ciring na am meybezbez a mangay ji Yeso.

1236551,"The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.",O aro a tao do Yotay a nimangay mapadnadna so pahad da Madiya meyketeh am macita da si Madiya meybezbez a makowbot.

","Makaranes ji Yeso si Madiya am meylilitod do tangain na. Maniring am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, no ka mina to ngyan do jya am jyabo na kanimawakwak no kakteh namen a."" "
1236553,"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, ",Macita na si Madiya kano aro a tao do Yotay amlavi am meyngen onowned na do pakacittan na sira. 
1236554,"and said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. ","Maniring jira am, ""Do wanjin nyo nibobwan nya."" Maniring sira am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, sijya pala, kacita mo sya."" "
1236555,Jesus wept. ,Karahan am mina to meykaoo a amlavi si Yeso. 
1236556,"Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! ","Maniring sira o tao do Yotay am, ""Asyo na tey karilaw si Lasalo eya."" "
1236557,"And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?","Maniring o tatasa jira am, ""Niwakwakan na o mata na no mavota tao am ikongo na ji ngiwakwaki ji Lasalo no keyngen na kaji na rana limanan."""
1236558,"Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. ",Makaranes si Yeso do heseb na am meyngen o onowned na amnakenakem sya. O heseb rana ori am asa ka azcip ori. O ngoso no nang am nipasengsengan da so rako a veysen. 
1236559,"Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. ","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Peylis kamo o veysen."" Maniring o kakteh na meyngaran si Marta am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, yajya kapat araw rana yanibobo a jyabo na kajyangotan no kataotao na."" "
1236560,"Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""Nipanci ko na jimo asyo o, 'No si anoyngan mo am macita mo o mapeyzokab a oyowyat ni Ama ta do to,' kwan ko imo asyoo."" "
1236561,"Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.","Karahan am peylisen da o rako a veysen. Maniring si Yeso a tomangara so hanit am, ""Mo Ama, ko isaray jimo an. Ta yamo na nyamizing o ciring ko. "
1236562,"And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.","Ko katenngan mo kapangday a yaomamizing so ciring ko. O ko peycirngan so sang am ko ipamizing so aro a tao a yamyan do katangked ko ito. Ta no si ori pa o anoyngan da jyaken a yamo nipahanhan do teyrahem."" "
1236563,"And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.","Mateyka na o ciring na am amlolos a manci no, ""Pakowbot rana mo Lasalo."" "
1236564,"And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.","Karahan am makowbot rana si Lasalo. O ai na kano lima na am mabedbed pa no milakayob. O moing na am nipongosan da no milakayob. Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Ovai kamo rana kalam na rana."""
1236565,"Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. ",Macita da o vazay ni Yeso no aro a tao do Yotay a nimangay tomazogaw ni Madiya am anoyngan da rana. 
1236566,"But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.",Am amyan so karwan da mangay manci no vazay ni Yeso do tao a macyagom do Vadisay. 
1236567,"Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. ","Am ori o nipeykaygi da no tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to. Maniring sira do kaygi da am, ""Yatey yaro o mapeyzokab a vazay na mina vazay. Meypanngonngo tamo. "
1236568,"If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. ","No si to ta amyapya o tao ori a kato da miminan no tao a omanod jya am jyabo kaji da angayan no Loma mangay komavakava so rako a panaralayan ta kabalinas da rana jyaten a."""
1236569,"And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, ","Amyan jira ang so asa ka tao a meyngaran so Keyava. Iya rana ori am panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to no kano nang. Maniring ori am, ""Yabo nyo katenngan. "
1236570,"nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. ","Manngwa, nyo jyatenngi o kapyapya na pa no keyyan no asa ka tao a mawakwak nyaten aro a tao do Yotay? No si jyakman sang am jyabo kaji ta miminan a mabalinas a."" "
1236571,"And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; ",Am o ciring eya am beken a meyngongyod a ciring na. Ta iya rana am panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to no kano nang. Am ori o nicyakma ney manoyonoyo so ciring ni Ama ta do to a manci ni Yeso a mangay mawakwak no tao do Yotay. 
1236572,"and not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. ","Beken a tao do Yotay o ikawakwak na, ta mangay na peylovolovoten o mavonong do peycyavanovanwan na omraralay ni Ama ta do to a tao akmey yasa rana."
1236573,Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death. ,Nimakalapo no kano nang o kanakenakem da no panipanirsirngen no tao do Yotay o kawakwak da si Yeso. 
1236574,"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.",Am ori o ji na rana mangilili ni Yeso do Yotay. So nimangay ni Yeso a kano macinanao jya do asa ka ili a meyngaran so Ivalyan a masngen do kabwan no nihakawan no tao a miseysan dang.
1236575,"And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. ",Omanam o Iyeci am aro tao a mangay do Yelosaleng a mangay mahap so iwawalam da omoyas do kataotao da. 
1236576,"Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? ","No kanang am to da ngala si Yeso. Maniring sira do kalwalovotan da rako a panaralayan am, ""Ala yaji ngai si Yeso a yamacipamaring so kanen ang."" "
1236577,"Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.","Nipanci da na no tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to do aro a tao o kapanci da no yanan ni Yeso, ta mangay da rakpen."
1236578,"Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. ",Kanem pa araw o awang na do Iyeci am nimangay si Yeso do Potani. Do dang rana am peyvahayan no nipeyvangon ni Yeso a si Lasalo. 
1236579,There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. ,Amyan do dang so tao a nimapowyab sya. Am o meyngaran so Marta kakteh ni Lasalo a mavakes am manaotao. Si Lasalo a kano aro a tao am macihanghang ji Yeso. 
1236580,"Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. ",Karahan am mangai si Madiya so mahangno a haneng. Ori rana am tey masingat ori. Karahan am to na rana mimina paglowen do ai ni Yeso a kalinas na jya no avok na. So nikahangno no sahad a yanan da. 
1236581,"Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, ","Maniring o asa ka macinanao ji Yeso a meyngaran so Yota a tao do Isecyadi a omavat do kapanazang na ni Yeso am, "
1236582,"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? ","""Apyapya rana o kapamalit nya so nizpi a ipanidong so ikasi a tao am. Ta tey masingat ori."""
1236583,"This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. ",To na mancyan ori am beken a meyngongyod o karilaw na no makasi a tao. Ta iya rana am manakaw a tao. Ta iya rana am masangib a tomakaw so italamozong na nizpi no kararay na. 
1236584,"Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.","Am maniring si Yeso am, ""To mo macyozai, ta ori rana am yavat na jyaken no ibobo da yaken. "
1236585,For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.,"Yamasangib sira o makasi a tao a yamacikaop jinyo. Am yaken am yalikey rana ipacikaop ko jinyo."""
1236586,"Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. ","Mamizing da si Yeso no aro a tao a amyan do Potani am mangay sira jya. Beken a kanakenakem da so kangay da ji Yeso, ta naknakmen da pa o kangay da tomita si Lasalo a nyavyay na ni Yeso. "
1236587,But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; ,Karahan am naknakmen da no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to o kapazanod da si Lasalo a wakwaken. 
1236588,"because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.","Ta tey yaro o tao do Yotay a ji rana ngonot do mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a omanoyong rana ji Yeso, do kanimapeyvangon na si Lasalo do heseb na."
1236589,"On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, ",Ikadwa na araw am o macipamarimaring so kanen a aro a tao am mamizing da si Yeso a mangay do Yelosaleng. 
1236590,"took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. ","Am ori o nipangap da so akmey voong no anyoy a mangay amrapong sya. Maniring sira amlololos am, ""Isaray ta si Ama ta do to. Inaoy si ipanlanlag na o nitovoy na a yarana nimai.

1236591,"And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, ","Makakala si Yeso so asa ka baka kavang na jya. So toney macipayoki no ciring do Seysyo. Ta maniring am, "
1236592,"Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. ","""Inyo a tao do Yelosaleng am ji kamo anyahey. Cita kamo o Panirsirngen nyo a yamavang do likta baka a yarana mai."""
1236593,"These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. ","No kano nang am ji da tenngi no macinanao jya o peypeypangayan na.

1236594,"The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. ",Tawagan ni Yeso si Lasalo apo do heseb na am amyan dang so aro a tao. So nipeylimwang da no akman sang a nimacita da vazay. 
1236595,"For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. ",Ori o nyangay da no aro a tao a mangay amrapong sya. Ta nimamizing da o kanimapeyvangon na si Lasalo. 
1236596,"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.","Maniring sira o tao a macyagom do Vadisay do kadwan jira am, ""Asyo tamo eya yabo so oyowyat a amzazat jira.

1236597,And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: ,Amyan so tao do Sila a nimangay do Yelosaleng a mamaring so kanen a omraralay ni Ama ta do to. 
1236598,"the same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. ","Sira rana am mangay da citahen si Veydipo a tao do Peysayta a ili a macinapnap do Cyadidi. Maniring sira jya am, ""Mo kahakay, namen kakdain si Yeso a macita."" "
1236599,Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.,Karahan am mangay na ipanci ni Veydipo ji Antele a kapeyheza da mangay manci nya ji Yeso. 
1236600,"And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Yarana makaranes o araraw no ikazway no Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta to a tao. "
1236601,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.",To ko na macitangayan jinyo am no ji pamowa do tana o mowahen am jyablis ori a asaha.

1236605,"Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. ","Mo Ama, inaoy si macita da no tao oyowyat mo.""

1236608,Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.,Oya rana o ipacici so tao do karawan. Oya rana o isakeb ni Satan a yatomalamozong no tao do karawan.

1236610,"This he said, signifying what death he should die. ",O peycirngan na sang am ipakateneng da jya no tao o kangay na mawakwak do jyojika.

1236612,"Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you.

1236616,"Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, ","Nimalavat na rana ni Isayya o kaji da manganoyngan. Ta maniring am, "
1236617,"He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; That they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, And be converted, And I should heal them.","""Si Ama ta do to o icyakma dey mavota.

1236628,"Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.",Kasaraw pa kapamaring da na so kanen do ngaranan da Iyeci am katenngan na rana ni Yeso o kakeykai na rana meysinaoli ji Ama na do to.

1236787,"They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. ","Maniring sira am, ""O tao do Nasale a meyngaran so Yeso."" Maniring si Yeso am, ""Yaken nyo ipanci ang."" O meyngaran so Yota a manazang nya am macizasing jira. "

1236792,"Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.

1236794,"Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, ",O itaysang no Loma kano panirsirngen da kano omzat do rako a panaralayan am rakpen da si Yeso a kavaod da sya. 
1236795,"and led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. ",Ney manoma na nyangayan da nya am meyngaran si Annase. Iya rana am icyarwa no maizay a yamapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to do kasa kawan ang a meyngaran si Keyava.

1236800,"And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.",Marekmeh no kano nang.

1236802,"Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Ko masangib a yamangnanao do da kalwalovotan no tao.

1236803,"Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.","Ikongo mo pacicyan jyaken. Apyapya rana o kangay mo mapacici so tao a yanimakamizing so nanao ko. Ta da katenngan o nipanci ko."""
1236804,"And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? ","Teyka na ni Yeso o ciring na am siplangan na o posngi na no yasa ka mamzat a kapanci na no, ""Ikongo mo to mancii no akman sang do panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to.""

1236805,"Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""No si myan so malas a ko nipanci am pancyaney do aro a tao eyto. Am no si manoyong o ciring ko am ikongo mo to niplangi jyaken."" "
1236806,Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.,Meyratateng am ipanci na ni Annase o tao a mangay ni Yeso do tao a meyngaran so Keyava a panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to. Am no kanang am mavaod pa si Yeso.
1236807,"And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. ","Meyratateng am to manangdang pa dang si Pite. Maniring jya o asa ka tao am, ""Beken a macinanao ka asyo ji Yeso?"" Maniring si Pite do alalasan na jya am, ""Beken a yaken."" "
1236808,"One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? ","Amyan so asa ka lamlamsoy no panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to. Iya rana am zipos no nipeycipas ni Pite so talinga.

1236809,Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.,"Maniring si Pite am, ""Jyabo a."" Am nimacinao no kano nang o katazokokok no manok."
1236810,"Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. ",Madagdag am hapen da si Yeso do yanan ni Keyava a vahay a kangay da nya do meymatmatngeh nira Loma tao a meyngaran so Pilato. Am ji sira nimacisdep o tao do Yotay.

1236812,"They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. ","Maniring sira am, ""No yabo na karatan am namen jyangayan jimo do jya."" "
1236813,"Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: ","Maniring si Pilato jira am, ""No komwan am angayan kamo rana. Ahahapan nyo na sya do iwawalam nyo."" Maniring sira am, ""Yabo oyowyat namen a to meyneynakem a manci no keyyan no raraten no tao a mangay wakwaken."" "
1236814,"that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.","Ori rana am mangononong o ciring ni Yeso, do kapanci na no kataotao na mangay da padketen do jyojika a wakwaken."
1236815,"Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? ","Karahan am somdep si Pilato do vahay a manci ni Yeso. Maniring jya am, ""Ka manoyong a panirsirngen da no tao do Yotay?"" "
1236816,"Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Yamanoyong a ciring mo ori an? No yamo nimamizing do tao."" "
1236817,"Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? ","Maniring si Pilato am, ""Mo ipanci yaken a tao do Yotay?

1236818,"Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Yaji yapo do tao do karawan o yako ipanalamozong.

1236819,"Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.","Maniring si Pilato jya am, ""Ka manoyong a panirsirngen an?"" Maniring si Yeso am, ""Imo yamanci nyaken a panirsirngen.

1236820,"Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. ","Maniring si Pilato am, ""Ikongo o manoyong a nanao."" Karahan am makowbot si Pilato. Maniring do aro a tao do Yotay am, ""Ko ji makakala so yasa ka raraten na a yako pangozayan a oyyan ko nya. "
1236821,"But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? ","Am ko to mangozai o iwawalam nyo. Ori rana am mangday do ipamaring nyo so kanen do Iyeci o kapasaway ko so asa ka marahet so nakenakem a tao. Manngwa, apyahen nyo yaken a mapasaway so panirsirngen nyo a tao do Yotay an?"" "
1236822,"Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.","Karahan am amlololos sira. Maniring sira am, ""Taosya a pasawain si Yeso. Ta si Palapa o pasawain."" (Si Palapa rana am manoyong a mangap so ahahapen.)"
1236823,"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. ",Karahan am ipanci ni Pilato o tao a somipsipzot ji Yeso. 
1236824,"And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, ","Karahan am nimamalikawag sira o itaysang no Loma so akmey tazici a pasakopen da ji Yeso a kapeyyayob da sya so akmey ayob no panirsirngen, "
1236825,"and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. ","kangay da do tangain na ni Yeso. Maniring sira am, ""Makapintek ka panirsirngen no tao do Yotay an,"" kasipsiplang da na sya. "
1236826,"Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. ","Meyratateng am makowbot pa si Pilato. Maniring do aro a tao am, ""Citahen nyo an, ta to ko na powbota yangay jinyo, do ko kaji makakalan so yana karatan."" "
1236827,"Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! ","Karahan am makowbot rana si Yeso a nipasakopan da so akmey tazici a kapeyyayob na so akmey ayob no panirsirngen. Maniring si Pilato jira am, ""Citahen nyo o tao eya."" "
1236828,"When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. ","Macita da si Yeso no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano omzat do rako a panaralayan am amlololos sira manci no, ""Padketen do jyojika. Padketen do jyojika."" Maniring si Pilato jira am, ""Ahap kamo na a kapadket nyo sya, ta yabo yako makala na karatan."" "
1236829,"The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.","Maniring sira o tao do Yotay am, ""Cyaha, ta amyan so iwawalam namen pangozayan ta amwakwak sya. Ta na to mancyan o kataotao na Anak na ni Ama ta do to."" "
1236830,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; ",Mamizing ni Pilato am to rana nyahey. 
1236831,"and went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. ","Karahan am somdep do vahay a kapacici na si Yeso. Maniring am, ""Do wanjin mo kapwan."" Am ji na nitovisan ni Yeso. "
1236832,"Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? ","Maniring si Pilato ji Yeso am, ""Mo ji novisi yaken? Naknakmen mo keyyan no oyowyat ko a mapasaway jimo. So iyan no oyowyat ko a manci no kawakwak da jimo."" "
1236833,"Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""O na iyan no oyowyat mo am si Ama ta do to. Am o yanitomoro nyaken jimo a tao am to makasi, ta tey arako o raraten na."""
1236834,"And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not C&#230; sar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against C&#230; sar.","Mamizing na ori ni Pilato am ji na rana tenngi a sidongen si Yeso a pasawain, ta yoyoywan da no tao do Yotay. Maniring sira am, ""No si pasawain mo am beken a kagagan na imo ni Kaysa a rako a panirsirngen do Loma. O manci no kataotao na panirsirngen am kavosoyan na o akman sang ni Kaysa."" "
1236835,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. ",Mamizing na o aro a ciriciring ori ni Pilato am ipakowbot na si Yeso a kalisna na rana ni Pilato do lilisnan na no mapacicici so tao a ngaranan da Niherahedan no Vato. O ingaran da jya no Sipolay a tao am Cyapata. 
1236836,"And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! ","Omanam o araraw no ipamaring da so kanen do Iyeci. Meyigen o araw no kano nang am maniring si Pilato do aro a tao do Yotay am, ""Cita kamo pala o panirsirngen nyo."" "
1236837,"But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but C&#230; sar. ","Karahan am amlololos sira o aro a tao. Maniring sira am, ""Wakwaken! Wakwaken! Padketen do jyojika."" Maniring si Pilato jira am, ""Nyo kakzeben yaken a mapadket so panirsirngen nyo?"" Maniring sira o panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am, ""Si Kaysa saon o panirsirngen namen a yasa ka tao am."" "
1236838,"Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. ",Karahan am itoro ni Pilato si Yeso jira mangay padketen do jyojika.
1236839,"And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: ","Karahan am yangay da na si Yeso, kapeyrara na rana so jyojika makowbot a meypangay do asa ka tokon a ngaranan da so Yanga no oo no tao. O ingaran da jya no Sipolay a tao am Keketa. "
1236840,"where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.",Do dang nipadketan da si Yeso. Amyan dang so rarwa ka marahet so yangay a nipazasing da. O asa am amyan do wanan na. O asa am amyan do ozi na a keyyan na ni Yeso do avak na. 
1236841,"And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. ","Amyan so nivatvatkan no lamlamsoy ni Pilato a nipayoray na do jyojika ni Yeso. O peypeypangayan no vatvatek am, ""Si Yeso rana am tao do Nasale a Panirsirngen da no tao do Yotay."" "
1236842,"This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. ","Aro tao do Yotay a nimakacita so sang, ta masngen o nipadketan da si Yeso do ili. O vatvatek ori am Sipolay a kano Lating a kano Sila o kavatvatkan na. So ipeykatlo no ciring a domket do dang. "
1236843,"Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. ","Maniring o panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to ji Pilato am, ""Ji mo padketa da kapeypanirsirngen sya no tao do Yotay. Ta apyapya pa o kapadket mo so mina ciring na a manci no kataotao na Panirsirngen no tao do Yotay."" "
1236844,"Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.","Maniring si Pilato am, ""Ji ko na ablisi o ko nipadket a vatvatek."""
1236845,"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. ","Mateyka da padketen si Yeso no itaysang no Loma am ahapen da o mina ayob na kapeykapat da sya vonongen. So nikaponged da teyhesa ka vovonongan. Karahan am ahapen da o katapil no ayob na. O ayob rana ori am ji da nitapang, ta asa ka ayob ori so kamamaogan a nicinon da. "
1236846,"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.","Maniring sira o itaysang no Loma do kadwan jira am, ""Ji ta misipisinga. Apyapya rana o kapasipangoyongoyot ta jya makahakahap rana sya."" O ikakman na sang am mangay mangononong o ciring do Seysyo. Ta maniring am, ""Da nivonong o nipeyyayob ko a da kapasipangoyongoyot do magorogod ko."" So nikanoyong no nang a mina vazay da no itaysang no Loma."
1236847,"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. ",O meytatanek do katangked no jyojika ni Yeso am si ina na kani kaminan na kani Madiya a mavakes ni Kelopo a kani Matelyan Madiya. 
1236848,"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!","Macita na ni Yeso si ina na kano ney kaglaw na a macinanao jya a meytatanek do dang am maniring ji ina na am, ""Mo ina, to mo na abneka anak mo."" "
1236849,"Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.","Maniring do macinanao jya am, ""To mo na abneka a ina mo."" Nimacipinda no kano nang o kapavahay na rana so ina na ni Yeso."
1236850,"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.","Katenngan na rana ni Yeso o kanikomavos no makakaday a vazay na. Maniring am, ""Ko mawaw."" O ikakman na sang am mangay mangononong o ciring do Seysyo. "
1236851,"Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. ",Amyan dang so asa ka panay a kapnowan no nipatavayan da so makopad a ranom. Karahan am pasivozen da o akmey tapaik do makopad a ranom a kapataroy da sya do akmey kamanakaoy a pasngenen do ngongoy na. 
1236852,"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.","To na nahamtama ni Yeso. Maniring am, ""Yarana nikomavos o vazay ko,"" kalogod na rana a mazavat so inawan."
1236853,"The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day, ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. ",Karahan am ipanci da ji Pilato no kamanrarakehan da no tao do Yotay o kavaci da so ai da no nipadket da do jyojika a tao a kakeykai da mawakwak a kapeypakas da rana so kataotao da do jyojika. O hapan da so akman sang a vazay am raten da o kato na ngyanan no kataotao da do jyojika do ipeywalam no tao do Yotay. Ta do ikadwa na araw am makdeng a ipamaring da so kanen. 
1236854,"Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. ",Am ori o nyangay da no itaysang no Loma amvaci so ai da no rarwa ka tao a nipazasing da do jyojika ni Yeso. 
1236855,"But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: ",Am mangay sira ji Yeso am macita da na nimawakwak rana. Am ori o ji da na amvaci so ai na. 
1236856,"but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. ",Am asa ka itaysang no Loma o nisomobsob no cinalolot so tagtagzang ni Yeso a kavoyog no rala na kano aswasoy no kataotao na. 
1236857,"And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. ",Ori rana am ciring na no nimakamatamata sya tao. So ikanoyong no akman sang a ciring na. Ta akma ney yongkad ori. So anoyngan nyo jya. 
1236858,"For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. ","O peypeypangayan no nang am mangay mangononong o ciring do Seysyo. Ta maniring am, ""Abo asa ka totowang na mavaci."""
1236859,"And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.","O asa ka ciring pa do Seysyo am, ""Pacimatan da o nisobsob da tao."""
1236860,"And after this Joseph of Arimath&#230; a, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. ","Makarahan am o tao do Adimatay a meyngaran so Yoseyvo am ipanci na ji Pilato o kahap na so kataotao ni Yeso. Am iya rana am anoyngan na no nang si Yeso. Am ji nadkeci o kapanci na nya do tao, ta ikanyahey na o panipanirsirngen no tao do Yotay. So nipyan na sya ni Pilato a mangay omkas so kataotao na ni Yeso a kahap na rana sya. "
1236861,"And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. ",O meyngaran so Niketemo a nikomala si Yeso do mahep no kakwa pa am nimacihza ji Yoseyvo. O nyahap na ikoris na ji Yeso a mahangno a haneng am akmey asa ka rako a vaklit so karwaro. 
1236862,"Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. ","Karahan am pakasen da si Yeso, kakoris da rana jya no haneng a kapongos da jya no malavang a milakayob. Ta ori rana am iwawalam da ori no tao do Yotay do nimapoling so peylingalingayan a tao. "
1236863,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. ",O nipadketan da si Yeso am masngen ori do peymowamowan no tao. Amyan dang so vayo a heseb a nidokdokan da mao. Am abo pa do dang o nimrakeh a tao a nipangay da do dang. 
1236864,There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.,Ikongo do omanam pa o araraw no ipeywalam da no tao do Yotay. Masngen o heseb do nipadketan da si Yeso. Am ori o to da rana pakakasai sya do dang.
1236865,"The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. ",Madagdag do niciyo am ji pa dada o araw. O meyngaran so Matelyan Madiya am nimangay do heseb ni Yeso. Am to na cita o rako a veysen do ngoso na nimapakaro. 
1236866,"Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. ","Karahan am malalayo a mangay ji Simong Pite a kano ney kaglaw na ni Yeso a macinanao jya. Maniring jira am, ""Da nyahap si Yeso do heseb na. Namen jyatenngi o da nipangayan sya."""
1236867,"Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. ",Karahan am mangay si Pite a kano asa ka macinanao ji Yeso do heseb na. 
1236868,"So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. ",Sira rana ori a rarwa am meyheza sira malalayo. Am magzagza pa o asa kani Pite. So nipanmanma na makaranes do heseb ni Yeso. 
1236869,"And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. ",Icingi na am milakayob rana o macita na. Am jya nimangay do sahad na. 
1236870,"Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, ","Makaranes si Simong Pite am mina to meytopos a somdep do heseb na. Am o milakayob macita na, "
1236871,"and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. ",kano milakayob a nipongos da do oo ni Yeso a makowkoo pa matarek so kazomtadan. 
1236872,"Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. ",O nimanmanma nimakaranes do heseb ori am somdep ori. Macita na am to na rana anoyngi do mina kapirwa na rana mavyay. 
1236873,"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. ",Am ji da pa tenngi o peypeypangayan no ciring do Seysyo do kawakwak na keypirwa na mavyay. 
1236874,Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.,Karahan am meyoli rana sira a mangay rana do vahay da.
1236875,"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, ",Meytatanek si Madiya a amlavi do pantaw na no heseb ni Yeso. Meyratateng am icingi na a meypangay do heseb na a tomita sya. 
1236876,"and seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. ",Am to makacita so rarwa ka tinsi ni Ama ta do to a meyyayob so malavang a amlisna do nipangayan da si Yeso. Asa am amyan do nipeypaowan da sya. Asa am amyan do niyanan no ai na. 
1236877,"And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. ","Maniring sira ji Madiya am, ""Ikongo mo ilavi."" Maniring si Madiya am, ""Da nyahap o kataotao na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ko. Ko jyatenngi o yada nipangayan sya."" "
1236878,"And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. ",Iptad na o ciring na am to na cita si Yeso a meytatanek do tangain na. Am ji na tenngi o ka si Yeso na. 
1236879,"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. ","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""Ikongo mo ilavi. Sino mo kalahen."" Manakenakem si Madiya am, ""Ala iya o yatomalamozong no peymowamowan eya."" Am ori o nipancyan na nya jya so, ""No imo yanimapeylis so kataotao ni Yeso am pancyaney jyaken mo nipangayan sya, ta mangay ko hapen do jya."" "
1236880,"Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. ","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Mo Madiya."" Citahen na ni Madiya am sirsirngen na no izezyak da no Sipolay. Maniring am, ""Laponi!"" O peypeypangayan na am, ""Mangnanao."" "
1236881,"Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Ji mo minani yaken, ta yako pa jya nimangay ji Ama. Angay da kakteh ko do cinai a kapanci mo nya jira so ko kapeysinaoli a mangay ji Ama a Tao do to ta. Ta iya rana am ta kalovotan a Tao do to."" "
1236882,"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.",Karahan am mangay rana si Matelyan Madiya manci nya do macinanao ji Yeso do kanimakacita na si Yeso a kapanci na no mina ciring na sya ni Yeso.
1236883,"Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.","Ahep no niciyo am malovot sira o macinanao jya. No kanang am nipakapya da o pangengneban a nisletan, ta ikanyahey da o panipanirsirngen da no tao do Yotay. Karahan am to meytatanek si Yeso do tangain da. Maniring am, ""Makapiya kamo so onowned an."" "
1236884,"And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. ",Teyka na o ciring na am ipacita na jira o lima na kano tagtagzang na. So nikasasaray da nimakacita si Yeso a Panirsirngen da. 
1236885,"Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Makapiya kamo so onowned an. To ko mangozai si Ama a nitomovoy jyaken. So ikakman ko sang a tomovoy jinyo."" "
1236886,"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:","Karahan am ahahan na sira. Maniring pa jira am, ""Ahapen nyo o Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to. "
1236887,"whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.","No si vonasen nyo o raraten no tao am todavonas rana. O ji nyo vonasa so raraten am jyavonas o raraten da."""
1236888,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. ",Asa do rarwa so ikakarwan a macinanao ji Yeso o meyngaran so Tomase. (O kasaing no ngaran na am si Nimeytovong a nimatazak a tao.) Iya rana am jya nimacikaop jira no kai ni Yeso. 
1236889,"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.","Maniring sira o karwan da am, ""Namen nimacita si Yeso a Panirsirngen ta."" Maniring si Tomase jira am, ""No si macita ko na a kapatoz ko so rokap ko do nipayorayan da so lima na do jyojika kapinan ko do tagtagzang na am ori saon o anoyngan ko jya am."""
1236890,"And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.","Ikawao na araw am malovot pa sira o macinanao ji Yeso. No kanang am macilovot rana jira si Tomase. Mangneb sira do kalovotan da vahay am to meytatanek si Yeso do tangain da. Maniring jira am, ""Makapiya kamo so onowned an."" "
1236891,"Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.","Maniring ji Tomase am, ""Patozey o lima mo do jya. Cita pala o lima ko. Pacisngen a kapinan mo do tagtagzang ko. Taosya rana kaji mo manganwanoyngan an. So ipanganoyong mo an."" "
1236892,"And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. ","Maniring si Tomase ji Yeso am, ""Mo Panirsirngen a Tao do to ko."" "
1236893,"Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.","Maniring jya si Yeso am, ""Mo na anoyngan yaken, ta mo na nimacita yaken? Am o to nganoyong jyaken a ji nimakacita jyaken am tey yapya sira ori."""
1236894,"And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: ",Aro pa dang o mina vazay na do tangain no macinanao jya mapeyzokab a vazay. Am yajya nipadket do vakong eya. 
1236895,"but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.",O yanipadketan so karwan na do vakong eya am anoyngan nyo ji Yeso a Misayya a Anak ni Ama ta do to. O manganoyong a tao am mahap da o to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da.
1236896,After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. ,Kadadayan na so araraw am mangay pa mapacita do macinanao jya do ngaranan da Tipilyo a rako a meybebneng a ranom. O mina vazay da no kano nang am yata malavat do jya an. 
1236897,"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. ",No kano nang am nimalovot sira Simong Pite a kani Tomase a meyngaran pa so Nimeytovong a nimatazak a tao a kani Natannay a tao do Cyana do Cyadidi a kano rarwa ka anak ni Sipitay a kano rarwa pa dang a kararay da a macinanao ji Yeso. 
1236898,"Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.","Maniring si Simong Pite do karwan da am, ""Ko mangay mangahahap."" Maniring o karwan da am, ""Macihza namen jimo."" Am ori o nilwas da do asa ka vazangay. Am abo inahahapan da kasahep."
1236899,"But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. ",Domada o araw am meytatanek si Yeso do pamsan na. Am ji da pa singkaji no macinanao jya si Yeso. 
1236900,"Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. ","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Kokay kamo. Kamo nimakamong an?"" Maniring sira am, ""Jyabo yasa namen nimamong a yakasahep a!"" "
1236901,"And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. ","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Zoywan kamo o tawaz nyo do kawanan, ta ori na yanan no among."" Karahan am izoyo da na o tawaz am ji da rana anat a pazagpiten, ta tey yaro rana o among do tawaz. "
1236902,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked, ) and did cast himself into the sea. ","Maniring ji Pite o ney kaglaw na ni Yeso a macinanao jya am, ""Si Yeso ya a Panirsirngen ta."" Mamizing ni Simong Pite o ka si Yeso na am meyyayob a kaokso na. "
1236903,"And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits, ) dragging the net with fishes.",Karwan da am kaoden da o vazangay makarala. Karahan am alikey rana kaji da makaransan do pamsan na am lolwen da na o tawaz a yanan no aro a among.
1236904,"As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. ",Makaranes sira do pamsan na am macita da o myanpaw a kano inmala rana a yanan no panazaban ni Yeso so among. 
1236905,"Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Pangap kamo pa do yanyo nimamong so apeleh."" "
1236906,"Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken. ",So nyangay na ni Simong Pite do vazangay amngingit so tawaz a ipakarala. Am mamimin a rarako a among o nimatawaz. Vilangan da na am atlo o ikasikanem na so ikarwa poo (153). Am jya nimapising o tawaz da no among ang. 
1236907,"Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. ","Maniring si Yeso jira am, ""Sijya kamo a karyag nyo."" Am abo o asa ka tao do macinanao jya o makadket jya pacicin, ta katenngan da o ka si Yeso na. "
1236908,"Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. ",Karahan am mangay jira si Yeso a kavonong na so myanpaw jira. Akman sang o among a vonongen na jira. 
1236909,"This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.",Ipitlo na rana ya ni Yeso a mapacita do macinanao jya no keypirwa na rana mavyay.
1236910,"So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.","Teyka sira romyag am maniring si Yeso ji Simong Pite am, ""Imo rana mo Simong a anak ni Yowani am manngwa, ka makdekdeng pa kano karwan nyo eya a maglaw nyaken an?""

1236911,"He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.","Ipidwa na pacicin am, ""Imo rana mo Simong a anak ni Yowani am manngwa, yamo ikaglaw yaken an?"" Maniring si Simong am, ""Noon. Mo katenngan yaken a yatey maglaw nimo."" Maniring jya si Yeso am, ""Peyveyveknen mo o omanoyong jyaken a tao a akma koy kagling."" "
1236912,"He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.","Ipitlo na pacicin ni Yeso am akman sang o ciring na.

1236913,"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.","To ko na macitangayan jimo am no kalavayo mo pa am to mo meyneynakman o angangayan mo.

1236914,"This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.","O peycirngan na so sang ni Yeso am pazimanen na ji Pite o pangavosan na no inawan na no makwa do kazwazway na si Ama ta do to. Maniring si Yeso ji Pite am, ""Macilolo ka jyaken."""
1236915,"Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? ",Meyvazingowngaw si Pite am macita na o ney kaglaw na macinanao ji Yeso a macihza jira. Iya rana ori am nimacitangked ji Yeso no kakan da a mapacici sya do keyyan no tao a manazang nya. 
1236916,"Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? ","Macita na ni Pite am maniring ji Yeso am, ""Meypanngonngo si Yowani eya no makwa."" "
1236917,"Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.","Maniring si Yeso jya am, ""No si ipanci ko kato na avyayan a mangay no yai ko na am ikongo mo kazyakan nya. To ka macilolo jyaken am."" "
1236918,"Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?","Karahan am o akman sang a ciring am todavangovangon.

1236919,"This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.",O ney kaglaw na ni Yeso a macinanao jya o yamapatwaw so aro a vazay eya a na kavatvatek jya. So namen pacyanoyngan do ciring na a tey manoyong.

Amen.",Aro pa o mina vazay na ni Yeso. Am no ko naknakmen am no si mamimin a vatvatkan am ji rana makangay do karawan o karwaro no vakong.

1236922,"until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen: to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: ",a mangay no kapeycyakavat na rana mangay do teyngato.

1236923,"and, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.","Ipisa no kalovot da pa am nipanci ni Yeso jira o, ""Si Yowani rana am nitaktakan na inyo no ranom.

1236924,"When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?

1236925,"And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.","Maniring jira si Yeso am, ""O akman rana sang a vazay a kano araraw na am si Ama ta do to o makateneng jya. "
1236926,"But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Jud&#230; a, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.","Am meyhekas jinyo o Seyzi.

1236927,"And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. ",Teyka na rana ori a ciring am meycyakavat rana si Yeso do teyngato. Tangarahen da am amyan so asa ka cinalab ambengbeng so citahen da.

1236975,"This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. ","""Ta si Yeso am nivyay ni Ama ta do to. Ta yamen rana am yongkad no akman sang a vazay. Ta nimacita namen rana ori a nimavyay. So namen pancyan nya jinyo. "
1236976,"Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. ",So na rana nipeycyakavat a yamyan do wanan na ni Ama ta do to a yamahap so itoro na jya ni Ama ta do to a Seyzi.

1236977,"For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, ","O nipanci na ni Tawey am beken a o kataotao na o nipanci na a nimangay do teyngato.

1236979,"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.","""Am ori an manga zipos a kakteh ko a Isedi a tao am naknakmen nyo an.

1236980,"Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? ","Mamizing da no aro a tao am marahet o onowned da. Am ori o nipacicyan da si Pite a kano kararay na a nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na.

1236981,"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

1236982,"For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. ","Ta ori o nipanci na itoro na jinyo a kano ananak nyo a pacyangayan da no tao do peycyamahamahatawan na. Ta tamo mamimin a rarahen ni Ama ta do to a Panirsirngen ta."""
1236983,"And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.","So ikaro na pa no ciring na ni Pite a pakoyokoin na jira.

1236984,Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. ,So ikaro da no tao a mahap rana so ipangnanao na a kataktak da rana jira. No kanang rana am omanoyong ji Yeso am nikarapan sira so kakatlwan a ranaw (3000) a tao.

1236986,And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. ,So ikaro no mapeyzokab a vazay da no nipamnekan na ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na a mapacita no rako a oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to. So ikaro no tao a somavasavak nya. 
1236987,"And all that believed were together, and had all things common; ","So ikatey yapya da no yamraralay ni Yeso a tao do kapeyyangangay da so onowned. So ikamimin da ji beywan do kangangay da do kadwan jira, "
1236988,"and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. ",kapanazang da no iheyhakaw da kano kangangay da do vahay da a kavonong da so nginangina na nizpi a itoro do kadwan jira. To da palololwa o itoro da do ikasi da tao. 
1236989,"And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, ","So ipangday da mangay a malwalovot do rako a panaralayan a meyyangangay so nakenakem.

1236990,"praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.",kazwazway da si Ama ta do to. So ikaro no tao a manci no kapiya no icicirawat da. Am ori o nipangday da do araraw a meyparo no tao a omanoyong ji Yeso.
1236991,"Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. ","Ipisa do ikatlo na vatvatek do makoyab am nimangay si Pite a kani Yowani do rako a panaralayan, ta ori o vatvatek no toki a ipeyneynozi da. "
1236992,"And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; ",Amyan so asa ka tao a mapilay nimakalapo no kalyalikey na.

1236993,who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. ,Macita na sira Pite a kani Yowani a somdep am pacyamyan na sira. 
1236994,"And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. ","Pacimatan da kapanci na nya ni Pite so, ""Cita pala yamen."" "
1236995,"And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.",So nicittan na sira a komakzeb so kapantan da nya. 
1236996,"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. ","Maniring jya si Pite am, ""Yabo jyamen o nizpi.

1236997,"And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. ","So nikatkatan na sya ni Pite so wanan na do lima na kasidong na sya meytatanek. So niyan no oyowyat na rana no ai na, "
1236998,"And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. ",a kapeytatanek na omalam rana a kapacihza na rana jira a somdep do rako a panaralayan a to nonoto a somaray nya ji Ama ta do to. 
1236999,And all the people saw him walking and praising God: ,Macita da no aro a tao a makakalam rana a somaray nya ji Ama ta do to am 
1237000,and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him. ,kasingkadan da rana a nimacyacyami do ngoso no rako a panaralayan. Am ori o nipeyzokaban da nya.
1237001,"And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.",No keyyan da rana do macinapnap do rako a panaralayan a ngaranan da so Vahay na ni Solomen am macikalay ji Pite a kani Yowani o nimapya rana so ai a tao ang.

1237002,"And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? ","Macita na ni Pite o aro a tao am maniring jira am, ""Inyo rana a keylyan ko a Isedi a tao am ikongo nyo kalakan no akman sya vazay ang. Ikongo nyo to nitai jyamen.

1237003,"The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. ",Beken a yamen ori. Ta si Ama ta do to a yada iraralay no ineynapo ta si Apolahan a kani Isa kani Yakebo o niomiwakwak jya. So ikanoyong na mazway ni Yeso.

1237005,"and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. ",Am ori o nizakatan nyo si Yeso a yapwan no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad. Am kanimapeyvangon na sya ni Ama ta do to. Yamen rana am yongkad na yamen a nimakacita sya.

1237007,"And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. ","""Am inyo rana manga keypong am nyo nizakat si Yeso. Am nyo jyatenngi ori a nitovoy na ni Ama ta do to. Tana panipanirsirngen nyo am akman sira so sang a ji makateneng jya. "
1237008,"But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.",No kakwa pa am nipanci na rana ni Ama ta do to do aro a panoyonoywan na so ciring o kapaziman da si Yeso a pakakasi nyo.

1237009,"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; ",Am ori o ipamlis nyo rana somazap si Ama ta do to. Ta ori o ivonas na so raraten nyo. 
1237010,"and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: ",Ta ipanta na inyo so vayo a ikasaray no onowned nyo. Ta yarana nimai si Yeso a Misayya a nitovoy ni Ama ta do to. 
1237011,"whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. ",Am to ngyan pa do teyngato si Yeso a mangay no si yavaywen ni Ama ta do to o makakaday amyan do teyrahem eya. Ta oya rana am nipanci ni Ama ta do to no kakwa pa do panoyonoywan na so ciring na.

1237013,"And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. ","O ji ngamizing so panoyonoywan na so ciring am pasyain na jyaten a balinasen ni Ama ta do to.'"""
1237014,"Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. ","Maniring pa si Pite am, ""Tana si Samoar a kano yamapalipalit a panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to am nimamimin da rana nipanci o akman sya vazay sicyaraw eya. "
1237015,"Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. ","Yaten o mahap so nipanci da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a kano nipanci na ji Apolahan.

1237016,"Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.","Am ori o panmanman na jyaten a tao do Yotay a tovoyan na si Yeso a somidong jyaten a ikaro ta do marahet a icicirawat ta."""
1237017,"And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, ",No kapangnanao da pa ni Pite a kani Yowani do aro a tao am to sira ngai o mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano panirsirngen da no mamzamzat do rako a panaralayan a kano tao a macyagom do Satokay. 
1237018,"being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. ","Meyoyaoya sira makamizing sya, ta ipangnanao da Pite a kani Yowani o kanimirwa na mavyay ni Yeso. Ta si Yeso am yongkad no kanoyong no nimawakwak rana tao a mirwa a mavyay. "
1237019,"And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide. ","Am ori o nirakpan da sira kapasdep da sira do pamemtengan mangay do ikadwa na araw, ta makoyab rana. "
1237020,Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.,Am no kanang am aro tao a niomanoyong do nipangnanao da Pite. O vilang da no mahakay am kakaliman a ranaw (5000).
1237021,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, ",Ikadwa na araw am o kamanrarakehan da no tao do Yotay a kano mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a kano karwan da no panipanirsirngen da am meylovolovot sira do Yelosaleng. 
1237022,"and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. ",O rako a panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a meyngaran si Annase a kani Keyava kani Yowani a kani Yadisanta kano zipos na mahakay ni Annase am amyan sira do dang. 
1237023,"And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?","Nyangay da sira Pite a kani Yowani do tangain da a kapacici da sira.

1237024,"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, ","No kanang rana am oyatan no Seyzi si Pite. Am ori o nipancyan na no, ""Inyo rana panipanirsirngen namen a kano kamanrarakehan am, "
1237025,"if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; ",no si myan jinyo so mapacici jyamen sicyaraw eya do namen kanimapeypapya so nimapilay a tao ori am 
1237026,"be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

1237027,"This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. ","O ciring do Seysyo no kakwa a omagaz ji Yeso am, 'O Vato a niwalit da no mapatnek so vahay am meyvoga am ney makdeng na aslet no ai no vahay.'"
1237028,"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.","Si Yeso o mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato. So ikabwata no ikararwa na do karawan a nitovoy na ni Ama ta do to a mapatazadang jyaten."""
1237029,"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. ",Macita da no panipanirsirngen do peykeykaygyan si Pite a kani Yowani a mowyat so onowned am manakem da rana sira todna ka tao a jya nimeyvatvatek. Am ori o nipeyzokaban da nira.

1237031,"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, ",To da na mancyan sira makowbot do rako a peykeykaygyan a kapeysirsiring da rana no panipanirsirngen. 
1237032,"saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. ","Maniring sira am, ""Kongwen ta sira ya, ta o meyvahay rana do Yelosaleng a tao am da katenngan sira yamapeyzokab so vazay. So ikabo no omalalas so sang a tao. "
1237033,"But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. ","Marahet si meyparo tao a makateneng do akman sang a vazay. Apyapya o kalalaw ta sira, kaji da makadketan do ngaran ni Yeso a ipeylimwang do tao."" "
1237034,"And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.",Am ori o nitawagan da jira mai a kalalaw da sira a manci nya jira so kaji da mangnanawan no ngaran ni Yeso a ipamizing so tao.
1237035,"But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. ","Am maniring si Pite a kani Yowani am, ""Do tangain ni Ama ta do to am amizngen namen o ciring nyo an? Ano amizngen namen o ciring ni Ama ta do to. Naknakmen nyo pala. "
1237036,For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. ,"Jyabo kaji namen mancyan no namen nimacita kano namen nimamizing a."""
1237037,"So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done. ","Meyratateng am peyparowen da o ciring da yalalaw da sira kapasaway da rana sira.

1237038,"For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.",O kakawakawan na no nimapilay a tao ori am to ngyan so ikasikalima (50) no awawan na ang.
1237039,"And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.

1237040,"And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: ","Mamizing da am malovot sira meynozi ji Ama ta do to.

1237043,"For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, ",So nipangononong no nang a mina vazay da do Yelosaleng eya.

1237047,"And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.

1237060,"And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. ",Hatasen na o ikatlo na vatvatek am mai rana o mavakes na. Am ji na tenngi pa o vazay ang. 
1237061,"And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. ","Maniring jya si Pite am, ""Manoyong ya karwaro no ngina no nihakawan nyo?"" Maniring am, ""Noon, manoyong ori."" "
1237062,"Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. ","Maniring si Pite am, ""Ikongo nakenakem nyo. Nyo kalalas do Seyzi ni Ama ta do to. Manngwa, 'Abo oyyan na nyamen ni Ama ta do to,' kwan nyo? Cita pala o yanimbobo no mahakay mo a yakai pa. So ikakman mo sang a yangay da ibobo."" "
1237063,"Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. ",Karahan am mavazakwang rana a mawakwak o mavakes ang. Somdep sira o malalavayo a tao a tomita sya am nimawakwak rana kahap da sya ipakowbot a mangay ibobo do katangked no mahakay na. 
1237064,"And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.",Mamizing da ori no omraralay ni Yeso a kano karwan no tao am tey maonib sira.
1237065,And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. ,Aro mapeyzokab a vazay da no nipamnekan na ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na a nimacita da no taotao. Mangday sira so araraw o omraralay ni Yeso a malwalovot do macinapnap do rako a panaralayan a ngaranan da so Vahay na ni Solomen. 
1237066,And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them. ,Ikanig da sira no tao do Yelosaleng. Am ji dadkeci no tao o kapacivaoy da jira. 
1237067,"And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.) ",Am nimeyparo sira omanoyong ji Yeso a mavakes a kano mahakay a macirapa jira. 
1237068,"Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. ",Macita da o mapeyzokab a vazay da no nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na am ori o nyangayan da no meykeyngeyngen a tao do ireyrayan da kapangay da sira do siri no rarahan. Ta tana avwavong na pa ni Pite a mangay jira am anoyngan da o kapya da. 
1237069,"There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.",Amyan so aro a tao a meyvahay do peycyeylilyan na masngen do Yelosaleng a nimai no meykeyngeyngen a tao a kano nikovotan no kalamsoyan ni Satan a tao a kamimin da nimapya rana.
1237070,"Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees, ) and were filled with indignation, ",O rako a panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kararay na macyagom do Satokay am ikeynanahet da sira o nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na. 
1237071,"and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. ",Am ori o nirakpan da sira kaneb da jira do pamemtengan. 
1237072,"But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, ","Mahep rana am amyan so tinsi ni Ama ta do to a nimiwang do pamemtengan a kapalolo na sira makowbot. Maniring jira am, "
1237073,"Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. ","""Mangay kamo do rako a panaralayan a meylimwang nya do taotao so omagaz do to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad."" "
1237074,"And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. ",Madagdag rana am somdep sira do rako a panaralayan a mangnanao. Meyratateng am o rako a panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kararay na am lovoten da sira o kamanrarakehan da no tao do Yotay a kapanovoy da so tao a mai no amyan do pamemtengan a nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na. 
1237075,"But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told, ",Am makaranes sira dang am abo rana sira. Am ori o nipeyoli da rana a mangay manci nya do aro a tao do rako a peykeykaygyan. 
1237076,"saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. ","Maniring sira am, ""Namen makaranes do pamemtengan am namen macita o pangengneban na yamakagi. O mamzamzat am yamyan do pantaw na. Namen iwangan am sira abo rana o tao do sahad na."" "
1237077,"Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.","Mamizing da no panirsirngen da no mamzamzat do rako a panaralayan a kano panipanirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am ikarahet da, ta ji da tenngi o nyangayan da no nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na. "
1237078,"Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. ","Am keyyan no asa ka tao a nimai a manci nya jira. Maniring am, ""O nyo nyaneban a tao am sira mangnanao so tao do rako a panaralayan."" "
1237079,"Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned. ","Am ori o nyangay da no mamzamzat a kano panirsirngen da amrakep sira. Am ji da bakbaki sira, ta ikamogaw da o tao. Ta ihawa da sira gomsagseh jira."
1237080,"And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them, ",Pasdepen da sira do rako a peykeykaygyan a kapatanek da sira do tangain da kapacici na sira no rako a panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to. 
1237081,"saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.","Maniring jira am, ""Namen nipaziman jinyo o kaji nyo mangnanawan no omagaz ji Yeso am ikongo nyo pangnanawan pa nya do Yelosaleng. Ikongo nyo pancyan nyamen a nimwakwak sya."""
1237082,"Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. ","Maniring si Pite a kano kararay na nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na am, ""Jyabo kaji namen ngamizngan si Ama ta do to a. Ta amizngan namen so tao. "
1237083,"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. ",Si Yeso rana nipadket nyo do jyojika niwakwak nyo am yana rana nivyay no Tao do to da no ineynapo ta. 
1237084,"Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. ","So na rana iyan do wanan na ni Ama ta do to a Panirsirngen ta a yamapatazadang jyaten do teyngato. Na kakzeben yaten a Isedi a tao a mamlis so nakenakem, ta ori o ivonas na so raraten ta. "
1237085,"And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. ","Am ori o namen peylimwangan no akman sya vazay. Ta yamen a kano Seyzi o yongkad na. Ta o Seyzi rana am na itoro ni Ama ta do to a macikaop do mahap so ciriciring na tao."""
1237086,"When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.",Mamizing da no panipanirsirngen am somozi sira. Am ori o ninaknakman da so kazakat da sira. 
1237087,"Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; ",Am amyan so kararay da meyngaran si Cyamadi. Iya rana am tao a macyagom do Vadisay a mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to. Iya rana am ikanig da no tao. To rana meytatanek si Cyamadi a manci no tao a mapowbot so nipamnekan na ni Yeso. 
1237088,"and said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. ","Maniring jira am, ""Inyo rana Isedi a tao am pakapyahen ta o ahahapan ta sira ya. "
1237089,"For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. ","Ta no keypisa am amyan so tao a nimai a meyngaran si Teota a mapakarakarang so kataotao na kapacilolo da no kakapatan a poo (400) a tao. Am wakwaken da si Teota am to sira na meyvwak o nimacilocilolo jya tao, kabo na rana no angangayan na. "
1237090,"After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. ",Meyratateng am amyan so asa ka tao do Cyadidi a meyngaran so Yota. No kano nang am ahapen no seyvo o vilavilang no tao do peycyeylilyan na. Aro nilittan na tao a macihza jya. Am wakwaken da am to sira na meyvwak o macilocilolo jya tao. 
1237091,"And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: ",O ko ipanci jinyo sicyaikwaya am to tamo macipanadngi sira. To ta na pasawaya sira. No si apo do tao o vazay da am to meycyabobo rana. 
1237092,"but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. ","Am no apo ji Ama ta do to am jyabo kapakaharag ta sira a. Ta o vazay ta rana am ta akmey to maciliman ji Ama ta do to."" So nyamizngan da so ciring na ni Cyamadi."
1237093,"And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.","Karahan am pasdepen da sira bakbakan, kapanci da nira ji rana meylimwang no ngaran ni Yeso a kapasaway da rana sira. "
1237094,"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. ",Karwan da o rako a peykeykaygyan am masaray sira. Ta nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to o karahet da sira a meyhanhan ni Yeso. 
1237095,"And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.","Mangday so araraw kangay da do rako a panaralayan a kado kavahayan a mangnanao so tao a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring ni Yeso, do kanoyong na Misayya a nitovoy ni Ama ta do to do teyrahem."
1237096,"And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. ",No kanang rana am meyparo sira omraralay ni Yeso. Am amyan so tao do Yotay a mapeyciring so ciring da no Sila a meyoyaoya. Ta ikarahet da sira o tao do Yotay a mapeyciring so ciring da no Sipolay. Ta ano meyvonong sira so isidong da sira am ji da pa vononga sira o vao a mavakes a meyzezyak so ciring da no tao do Sila. 
1237097,"Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. ","Am ori o nilovotan da so aro a sinjya no rarwa so ikakarwan a nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na a kapanci da nya jira so, ""Si iptad namen o kapeylimwang namen no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a amvonong so isidong ta so tao am marahet o akman sang, ta ikasanga namen. "
1237098,"Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. ","Am ori o ipamnek nyo so papito a ka tao a katenngan no tao apiya so icicirawat a kano mateneng a oyatan no Seyzi, ta sira rana o to namen rana pahanhana a omvonong sya. "
1237099,"But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. ","Am yamen rana am kasazap namen so kapeynozi a meylimwang no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to."""
1237100,"And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: ","Mamizing da no aro a sinjya am mamimin sira amya sya. Am ori o nipamnekan da ji Setiven, ta meysominogat o nakenakem na ji Ama ta do to a oyatan no Seyzi, a kapamnek da pa ji Veydipo a kani Polokelo a kani Nike a kani Timen a kani Pamona kani Nikela. Si Nikela rana am beken a tao do Yotay, ta tao do Antia a mahap rana so iwawalam da no tao do Yotay. "
1237101,"whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. ",So nipancyan da nira meytatanek do tangain da no nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na a meynozi nira maparapong so lima da jira ipowyat da sira do akman sang a vazay da.
1237102,And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. ,Am ori o nipeylimwang na rana no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o to da raparapai jira no omanoyong ji Yeso do Yelosaleng a karo da rana. Tana mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am aro sira omanoyong rana ji Yeso.
1237103,"And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.","Si Setiven rana am aro mapeyzokab a vazay na do tangain da no tao, ta sidongen na ni Ama ta do to a kowyat na jya no Seyzi. "
1237104,"Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. ",Am amyan so tao a macioya jya a somkad jya. O tatasa jira am tao do Yotay apo do Cidinay a kado Yadisanta. Sira rana am manaralay do ngaranan da so Peyneynozyan da no somaliway rana tao. O karwan da am tao do Yotay apo do Cidicya kado Yasiya. 
1237105,And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. ,"Am ji da tenngi a pasapan o ciring ni Setiven, ta nipanta na no Seyzi so teneteneng na. "
1237106,"Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. ","Am ori o nipeykala da so tao a katoro da jira so nizpi a meykala so karatan na ni Setiven. Maniring sira am, ""O tao rana ya am namen nimamizing a yamraherahet si Moyse a kani Ama ta do to."" "
1237107,"And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, ",Ori o nisozi da no aro a tao a kano kamanrarakehan a kano mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to. Ori o nirakpan da si Setiven a yangay do rako a peykeykaygyan. 
1237108,"and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: ","So niyan da do dang no nipanta da so nizpi a tao a mangamaog so malas a ciring a iraherahet da sya. Maniring sira am, ""O tao rana ya am yamangday a yamraherahet so rako a panaralayan ta ya kano iwawalam ni Moyse. "
1237109,"for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. ","O nimamizing namen a nipanci na am si Yeso a tao do Nasale am kavahen na o rako a panaralayan eya, kablis na do iwawalam ni Moyse a nitaid na jyaten."" "
1237110,"And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.",So nikamimin da no myan do peykeykaygyan a tao a tomita si Setiven. Karahan am macita da o moing na akmey moimoing no tinsi.
1237111,"Then said the high priest, Are these things so? ","Pacicin no rako a panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to si Setiven. Maniring sira am, ""Manngwa, yamanoyong o na keyyan no akman sang a vazay mo an?"""
1237112,"And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, ","Pasapan na ni Setiven am, ""Manga maran, manga kakteh, amizngen nyo yaken an. No kakwa pa am nimapacita o mazway a si Ama ta do to ji Apolahan no keyyan na pa do Meysopotamiya a meypanam pa a meyvahay do Alan a ili. "
1237113,"and said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. ","Maniring jya am, 'Karwan mo o ili nyo a kano apapnan mo a mangay do tovoyan ko jimo an.'"
1237114,"Then came he out of the land of the Chald&#230; ans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. ","Am ori o nikarwan na jya ni Apolahan do Cyaloti a pongso a kangay na meyvahay do Alan. Mawakwak si ama na am ori o nyangay na rana do meyngongyod a tovoyan na sya ni Ama ta do to, do ili ta ya. "
1237115,"And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.",No kanang am abo pa nitoro na jya ni Ama ta do to a iheyhakaw na. Am nipanci na pa jya ni Ama ta do to no kakwa am itoro na jya o ili ta ya a lisanan da no apwapo na. Am no kanang am abo pa o anak na ni Apolahan. 
1237116,"And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years. ","Maniring pa jya si Ama ta do to am, 'O sivosivovoong mo am meyvahay sira do teysa ka mahataw an, a kapeylamlamsoy da sira dang a peyrarehten so sikapat a poo (400) so awawan. "
1237117,"And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. ",Am pasingsingtan ko sira o mapeylamlamsoy sira a tao do teysa ka mahataw a kakaro da rana do dang a meysinaoli do jya kararalay da nyaken.'
1237118,"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs. ","Meyratateng am ipanci na ni Ama ta do to ji Apolahan o keyyan na no yongkad na jira do ananak na mahakay, do kaji da makahamangan do nipanci na jira ni Ama ta do to.

1237119,"And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him, ","Maniring pa si Setiven am, ""Asa do anak ni Yakebo a meyngaran so Yoseyvo am nikeynanahet da no kakakteh na. Am ori o nipanazangan da nya do tao do Ayci. Am mina kapzat na jya ni Ama ta do to, "
1237120,"and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. ",do meycyamadadayan a kanginanawan na. Nipanta na ni Ama ta do to so teneteneng na. Am ori o nikakza na nya no rako a panirsirngen da do Ayci a meyngaran so Valaw. Am ori o nipamnekan na nya tomonton jya meypanirsirngen do Ayci a tomalamozong no kangangay na kano kanekanen na.
1237121,"Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. ","""Mownay am meykabcil do Ayci a kado Cyanan a pongso. Am ori o nikaro no alalaw da no ineynapo ta, ta abo rana o kanekanen da do Cyanan. "
1237122,"But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. ",Mamizing na ni Yakebo o kabsoy da no Ayci am tovoin na sira o anak na a ineynapo ta mangay do Ayci. Ori am ikeypisa da pa ori a yanimangay. 
1237123,And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh. ,Ipidwa so kangay da am ipanci na ni Yoseyvo o kataotao na da kakakteh na. Ori o nipakatenngan na rana ni Valaw do kakakteh na ni Yoseyvo. 
1237124,"Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. ",So nipanovoy na so tao ni Yoseyvo a manci ni ama na kano aro a zipozipos da mai do Ayci. O nimai a apapnan na am lalima o ikasikawao da (75). 
1237125,"So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, ",Am ori o nyai da rana do Ayci a meyvahay a kato da wakwakan do dang ni Yakebo a kano ananak na a ineynapo ta. 
1237126,"and were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. ",Mownay am anaten da o totowang da yangay do Secyan a ili do ninginangina na ni Apolahan a heseb no kakwa pa do ananak na ni Hamo.
1237127,"But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, ","""Toda jyarateng o mina ciring na ni Ama ta do to ji Apolahan am nisomaod sira o ineynapo ta do dang. "
1237128,"Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph. ",No kanang rana am amyan so nimacipalit a vayo a panirsirngen no tao do Ayci. Am ji na pa nimamizing si Yoseyvo no kakwa pa. 
1237129,"The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.",Am ori o nikarahet na no niyokodan na no ineynapo ta a peyrarehten. Ipanci na o kapipowa da no anak da kawakwak da. 
1237130,"In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months: ",No kanang rana am nimatazak a tao si Moyse. Apiya o kamahamahakay na. Ikatlo na vehan am nitayo da do vahay da a peyveyveknen. 
1237131,"and when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. ",Marateng rana o araraw no nipasazokaw da sya am macita na no mavakes a anak na ni Valaw. Am ori o nyahapan na sya azwazovwen a kabnek na sya anak na. 
1237132,"And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. ",So ninanawan da sya no iwawalam da do Ayci. So ikateneng na mapehtaw so ciring a mateneng do ahahapan na so vazay na.
1237133,"And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. ","""Sikapat a ngarnan (40) o kakawakawan ni Moyse am naknakmen na o kangay na tomita so keylyan na Isedi a tao. "
1237134,"And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian: ","Makaranes am to na cita o asa ka keylyan da ji dasnesnekan no tao do Ayci. Am ori o nyangay na mabong no keylyan na, kazakat na so tao do Ayci. "
1237135,for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not. ,"O nakenakem na ni Moyse am, 'Ala katenngan da yaken no keylyan namen a nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a makasidong sira do peyrarehten da sira no tao do Ayci.' Am ji da tenngi ori no keylyan da. "
1237136,"And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? ","Ikadwa na araw am macita na o rarwa ka keylyan da meyliman. Am ori o nipeyyawwan na sira. Maniring jira am, 'Manga kahakay, inyo rana am kamo meykeylyan. Ikongo nyo ipeyliman.' "
1237137,"But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? ","Am o mapeymetdeh so kararay na am nimapadondon si Moyse. Maniring jya am, 'Sino nimanci nimo a yamyokod nyamen. "
1237138,"Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? ",Mo zakaten yaken a akman so nizakat mo no kakyab a asa ka tao do Ayci?'
1237139,"Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons. ","Mamizing na ni Moyse am malalayo a komaro rana do Ayci a mangay meyvahay rana do Miteyang a ili, kapeytaodtod na dang so rarwa ka mahakay."
1237140,"And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.

1237141,"When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, ","Macita na ori ni Moyse am mina to ogto a kapeypasngen na tomita sya. Karahan am to na amizing o ciring na ni Ama ta do to a manci no, "
1237142,"saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold. ",'Yaken rana am Tao do to da yaken no ineynapo nyo si Apolahan a kani Isa kani Yakebo.' So nizikzik na ni Moyse a maonib nya. Ori ji na nitomitai sya. 
1237143,"Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. ","Maniring pa jya si Ama ta do to am, 'Pakaro o tokap mo, ta o mo peytatankan eya am yako yanan. "
1237144,"I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.

1237145,"This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.

1237146,"He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.","Si Moyse o nitomirara so ineynapo ta a komaro do Ayci.

","Si Moyse o nimanci nya do Isedi a tao so, 'No makwa am amyan pa do sivosivovoong nyo so panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a tovoin na jinyo akman jyaken a nitovoy na jinyo a Isedi.'"
1237148,"This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us: ","Si Moyse o nipacisirsirngan no tinsi do tokon a meyngaran so Sinay, no keyyan da pa no ineynapo ta do kabwan no nihakawan no tao.

1237149,"to whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, ","""Am ji da nyamizing si Moyse no ineynapo ta, ta manakem da o kapeysinaoli da pa do Ayci. "
1237150,"saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. ","Amyan pa si Moyse do tokon am nimangay sira do kakteh na a meyngaran so Yalon a manci no, 'Ipamaring mo pa yamen so iraralay namen an, a kapangonong na nyaten do rarahan.

1237151,"And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. ","So nipamaring da so likta baka a iraralay da a papazosan da, kapamaring da so kanen a somaray no nipariparing da a iraralay da. "
1237152,"Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices By the space of forty years in the wilderness?","Am ori o nikarwan na jira ni Ama ta do to, ta ioya na sira a omraralay no mata no hanit akman so nivatvatkan da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a manci no, 'Inyo rana Isedi a tao am nimanzakat kamo so vinyay a ipazos nyo do iraralay nyo no keyyan nyo pa do kabwan no nihakawan no tao so sikapat a ngarnan (40) so awawan.

1237162,Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: ,Amyan so asa ka panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a ji da nipakakasi no ineynapo nyo an?

1237165,"But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, ",Am nioyatan no Seyzi si Setiven.

1237167,"Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, ","Amlololos sira somengseng do cicilwan da kakarakararwa da ji Setiven a rakpen, "
1237168,"and cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.

1237171,"And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Jud&#230; a and Samaria, except the apostles. And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.","Yamyan so amraralay ni Yeso a nimonong do inawan na ni Setiven.

1237172,Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. ,O nimeyvwak a nimraralay ni Yeso am mangay sira do peycyeylilyan na a meylimwang no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a omagaz ji Yeso. 
1237173,"Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. ",O asa jira am si Veydipo am nimangay do asa ka ili do Samadiya a meylimwang no kanoyong na ni Yeso a Misayya a nitovoy ni Ama ta do to do teyrahem. 
1237174,"And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. ","So ikaro da no tao a omanoyong do nipanci na jira ni Veydipo, ta nimacita da o mapeyzokab a vazay na. "
1237175,"For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. ",Ta aro sira o tao a nipamozwawan na so kalamsoyan ni Satan. Mavozwaw sira am amlololos sira makowbot do kataotao no tao. So niyan da no aro a makasapa a tao a nimapya rana. 
1237176,And there was great joy in that city.,So ikasasaray da no tao do dang.
1237177,"But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: ",Amyan so asa ka tao a meyngaran si Simong a meyvahay do ili ang. Amyan so vazay na ikalak da no tao. Pahamahen na o kataotao na a manci no kaizay na tao. 
1237178,"to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. ","So ikamimin da no tao do dang, tana maizay a tao a tana todna ka tao am ikakza da amizngen, ta patolinen da oyatan na ni Ama ta do to. "
1237179,"And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. ","Ikongo do mownay rana ori a meyvazay no mapangyangyalak a vazay, am ori o ikaro da no tao a nimacilolo jya. "
1237180,"But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. ",Ipeylimwang na ni Veydipo o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a omagaz do italamozong na kano ngaran ni Yeso Kizisto am anoyngan da no nimyan dang a mahahakay a kano mavavakes kataktak da jira. 
1237181,"Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.",Tana si Simong am mina to na nganoyngi rana a kataktak da jya.

1237182,"Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: ",O nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na amyan do Yelosaleng am mamizing da o keyyan no tao do Samadiya a mahap rana so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o nitovoyan da si Pite a kani Yowani a mangay jira. 
1237183,"who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: ",Makaranes sira dang am ipeynozi da sira o omanoyong rana ji Yeso a keyyan na jira no Seyzi. 
1237184,(for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) ,Ta no kano nang rana am ji pa nimeyhekas jira o Seyzi do mina kataktak jira no ngaran na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. 
1237185,"Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.",Am ori o nipaoptan da jira so lima da da Pite a kani Yowani a ipanlanlag da. Ori o niyan na rana jira no Seyzi.
1237186,"And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, ",Citahen ni Simong o nipaoptan da so lima da Pite a kani Yowani a yanan na rana no Seyzi am ipanta na sira so nizpi. 
1237187,"saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. ","Maniring am, ""Itoro nyo jyaken oyowyat ori a torwan ko inyo so nizpi, kapaopta ko so lima ko do tao a keyyan na rana jira no Seyzi."""
1237188,"But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. ","Maniring si Pite am, ""Paciralay do nizpi mo a matemtem, ta yamalas o aktokto mo do kanginangina mo so oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to no nizpi mo. "

1237190,"Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. ",So ipamlis mo na komaro do malas a nakenakem mo a kapeynozi mo ji Ama ta do to. Ta ala vonasen na o marahet a nakenakem mo. 
1237191,"For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. ","Ta na imo vaoden no mo panginanehtan do tao a kano meycyamadadayan a raraten mo."""
1237192,"Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.","Maniring jira si Simong am, ""Ipeynozi nyo yaken an, kaji na meydednan jyaken no nyo ipanci ang."""
1237193,"And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.",Mateyka si Pite a kani Yowani a mangnanao no ciriciring ni Ama ta do to am meyoli rana sira a mangay do Yelosaleng a kapeylimwang da no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to do peycyeylilyan na do Samadiya a nipeyliktawan da ili.
1237194,"And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. ","Amyan so asa ka tinsi ni Ama ta do to a nimangay ji Veydipo. Maniring am, ""Mangonong ka do rarahan apo do Yelosaleng a mangay do Cyasa."" Jyasangibi no tao a panahanan. "
1237195,"And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.",Karahan am mangay rana si Veydipo.

1237196,"Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. ","Maniring o Seyzi ji Veydipo am, ""Mangay ka macikasngen do aleleh ang."" "
1237197,"And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? ","Am ori o nipalayo na a mangay ni Veydipo. So nipakamizngan na so tao ang a omvilang do vakong ni Isayya. Maniring jya si Veydipo am, ""Mo katenngan o mo vilangan ang?"" "
1237198,"And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. ","Maniring am, ""Si myan so amnanao jyaken am ori o ipakateneng ko jya."" Am ori o nipancyan na ni Veydipo a somakay do aleleh na. "
1237199,"The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And like a lamb dumb before his shearer, So opened he not his mouth:","O vilangan na no tao do Isopiya a ciring ni Ama ta do to am, ""Iya rana am akmey kagling a alaken da zakaten a to norotoro no kataotao na. So icyakma ney likta kagling a tedtedan da so bobow a ji meyzezyak."
1237200,In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: And who shall declare his generation? For his life is taken from the earth.,"No kapeymetdeh da sya am abo macingosongoso nya. Abo o tomapil jya sivosivovoong na, ta makeykai o allallag na mabo do karawan."""
1237201,"And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?","Maniring o tao do Isopiya do pacicyan na si Veydipo am, ""Pancyan pala jyaken o na pakacirngan sya no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to eya.

1237202,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. ",Karahan am ipanci na ni Veydipo o ka si Yeso na no agagazan no nivilangan na a kananao na sya no Mapasaray a Ciriciring ni Yeso. 
1237203,"And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? ","Meyratateng am manahan sira do masngen do ranom. Maniring o tao do Isopiya am, ""Yamyan jya so ranom. Apya o kataktak mo jyaken do jya?"" "
1237204,"And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. ","[Maniring si Veydipo am, ""Si manoyong o onowned mo am ori o taktakan ko jimo."" Maniring am, ""Ko anoyngan si Yeso a Kizisto a Anak ni Ama ta do to.""]"
1237205,"And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. ",Am ori o nipaseykedan na so aleleh a kapacihza na ji Veydipo a mangay do ranom a kataktak na jya. 
1237206,"And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. ",Karwan da rana o ranom am ahapen na no Seyzi si Veydipo. Am ori o ji na nimakacitai rana sya no tao do Isopiya. Mangay rana ori am masaray rana o onowned na. 
1237207,"But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to C&#230; sarea.",Nimacita da rana no tao si Veydipo do Atsoto a ili a kalivon na so peycyeylilyan na peylimwangan no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to mangay no kapakaranes na rana do ili do Kaysadiya.
1237208,"And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, ","No kanang rana am ji namtadan ni Sawlo o kalalaw na so omraralay ni Yeso a tao a zakaten. Am ori o nyangay na do rako a panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to, "
1237209,"and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. ","ta kakzeben na o kapeyteygami na no tomalamozong no aro a peyneynozyan da no tao do Yotay do Tamaseke a ili a manci no kapya da sya omrakep so amraralay ni Yeso a tao, tana mahakay a tana mavakes am miminen na sira yangay do pamemtengan do Yelosaleng."
1237210,"And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: ",Masngen rana do Tamaseke am to ngyan so zezak apo do teyngato a tomiray sya. 
1237211,"and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?","Am ori o nikavazakwang na do teyrahem a kapakamizing na so macisirsiring jya. Maniring am, ""Sawlo, Sawlo, ikongo mo pakakasyan jyaken."" "
1237212,"And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.","Maniring am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, sino ka."" Maniring am, ""Yaken rana am si Yeso ko a yamo pakakasin. "
1237213,"And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.","Peyvangon rana mangay do ili, ta yamyan so asa ka tao a manci nya jimo so vazay ko jimo."" "
1237214,"And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. ","O kararay ni Sawlo am tey maonib sira, ji rana makapeyzezyak, ta amyan so mamizing da am ji da cita. "
1237215,"And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. ",Meyvangon si Sawlo am peyvezezngen na o mata na am ji makacita. Ori o nyalakan da sya no kararay na yangay do Tamaseke. 
1237216,"And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.","So nipakatlo na araw a jya nimakacita, jya nimangakaday."
1237217,"And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.

1237218,"And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, ","Maniring si Yeso am, ""Mangay ka do ngaranan da so Matazineng a rarahan. Ta myan do vahay ni Yota o asa ka tao do Tasose a meyngaran si Sawlo a yameynozi dang. "
1237219,"and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.","Nipaziman ko na jya o katovoy ko jimo a mangay a somidong sya a mapaopta so lima mo a kapakacita na rana."" "
1237220,"Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: ","Maniring si Ananiya am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, ko nimamizing rana do aro a tao o marahet a vazay na do keyyan da no aro a nipakakasi na a omraralay nimo do Yelosaleng. "
1237221,and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. ,"Iya rana am nipya da no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a mangay a omrakep so omraralay nimo a tao."""
1237222,"But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:","Maniring jya si Yeso am, ""Mangay ka, ta ko nipamnekan si Sawlo a mahap so vazay ko a meylimwang no ngaran ko do beken a tao do Yotay a kano aro a panipanirsirngen, pacyangayan nyo a Isedi a tao. "
1237223,for I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.,"Ta pazimanen ko jya o karo no alalaw na do ipeyvazay na jyaken."""
1237224,"And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. ","Am ori o nyangay na rana ni Ananiya. Somdep rana do vahay am paoptahen na o lima na do kataotao na ni Sawlo. Maniring am, ""Mo kakteh, o mo nimacita do rarahan a Panirsirngen ta si Yeso am na nitovoy yaken a mai a tomazogaw nimo. Ta kakzeben na imo a makacita rana a italamozong no Seyzi."" "
1237225,"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. ",Mamizing na ni Sawlo o ciring na am mina todakas do mata na o akmey isis no among. So nipakacita na rana. Am ori o nipeyvangon na rana kataktak da jya. 
1237226,"And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus. ","So nipangakaday na rana a kowyat na rana no kataotao na. Kadadayan na so araraw am amyan pa si Sawlo do Tamaseke a macihza jira do omraralay ni Yeso, "
1237227,"And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. ",a kangay na do aro a peyneynozyan a meylimwang ni Yeso a manoyong a Anak na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237228,"But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests? ","Mamizing da no aro a tao am isavasavak da. Ori o nipancyan da nya do kadwan jira so, ""Beken a oya asyo o nimapakakasi so omraralay ni Yeso a tao do Yelosaleng?

1237229,"But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.",So ikatey mateneng na ni Sawlo a mangnanao a jyamogaw a macinekanekad jira a manci ni Yeso a Misayya. Am ori o ji da makatenngi jya pasapan no aro a tao do Yotay do Tamaseke.
1237230,"And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him: ",Kadadayan na do araraw am ipeysirsiring da o kazakat da si Sawlo no tao do Yotay. 
1237231,but their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him. ,So ipangday da do maraw a kado mahep omavat ji Sawlo a zakaten no makowbot do ili. Am keyyan no tao a nimanci nya ji Sawlo. 
1237232,"Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.",Am ori o nitontonan da sya no sinjya do mahep do rako a yala do likod no makarang a atoy no ili da kakaro na rana dang.
1237233,"And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple. ","Makaranes si Sawlo do Yelosaleng am naknakmen na o kapacikaop na do omraralay ni Yeso a tao. Am nikanyahey da, ta ji da anoyngi o kanoyong na rana omanoyong ji Yeso. "
1237234,"But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. ",Am kanisomidong na sya ni Parnapo a mangay tomita so nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na a kapanci na nya jira so mina kapakacita na ni Sawlo si Yeso do rarahan a nisomirisiring sya a kapanci na pa nya jira so kaji na mogawan ni Sawlo a meylimwang ni Yeso do Tamaseke. 
1237235,And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem. ,Am ori o nikabwangan da rana ji Sawlo no nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na. So ji na nimamogawi a meylimwang ni Yeso do Yelosaleng. 
1237236,"And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. ",No kanang am nimacisirsiring a kapacinekanekad na do tao do Yotay a meyzezyak so ciring da no tao do Sila. Am naknakmen da o kazakat da si Sawlo. 
1237237,"Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to C&#230; sarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.",Katenngan da no akma ney kakteh do cinai o akman sang a vazay am yangay da do Kaysadiya katovoy da sya mangay rana do meyngongyod a ili da do Tasose.
1237238,"Then had the churches rest throughout all Jud&#230; a and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.",No kanang rana am abo rana o ikalaw da no omraralay ni Yeso a tao do Yotay a kado Cyadidi a kado Samadiya.

1237239,"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. ","Si Pite rana am nilivolivon na o peycyeylilyan na angayan na tomazogaw no omraralay ni Yeso a tao. Makaranes do Dita am, "
1237240,"And there he found a certain man named &#198; neas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. ","macita na dang o asa ka tao a meyngaran si Aynayya. Iya rana am nimakasapa tao, mina kawao (8) a kawan a jya nimeyvavangon. "
1237241,"And Peter said unto him, &#198; neas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. ","Maniring jya si Pite am, ""Mo Aynayya, peyvangon rana kahap so ireyrayan mo. Ta na rana nipeypapya imo ni Yeso Kizisto."" So nikapya na rana. "
1237242,"And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.",Macita da ori no aro a tao a meyvahay do Dita kado Salon am anoyngan da rana si Yeso.
1237243,"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. ","Do Yepey rana ili da am amyan so asa ka mavakes a omraralay ni Yeso a meyngaran si Tapitay. O ngaran na do ciring no Sila am si Tocya. Peypeypangayan na am ibosbosan. Aro apiya vazay na, ta sidongen na sira o abo so nizpi a tao. "
1237244,"And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. ",Amyan si Pite do Dita am meyngen a kawakwak na rana ni Tapitay. Am ori o niryosan da sya kapangay da sya do kavava no vahay na. 
1237245,"And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. ","Manovoy sira so rarwa ka tao a mangay ji Pite, ta mamizing da si Pite amyan do Dita. Maniring sira am, ""Makeykai ka mangay do ili namen."" "
1237246,"Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. ",So nipacihza da rana ji Pite a mangay do Dita. Makaranes sira am yangay da do kavava no vahay na ni Tapitay. So nikamimin da no vao a mavakes amlimot sya amlavi a mapacita no nitapang na ni Tapitay a ayob da no kapeyigegen na pa do karawan. 
1237247,"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up. ","Karahan am powboten na sira ni Pite a kapeylilitod na meynozi a somazap so kataotao na ni Tapitay. Maniring am, ""Mo Tapitay, peyvangon rana."" Meyratateng am meyvezezeng o mata na a makacita si Pite kapeyvangon na rana amlisna. "
1237248,"And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive. ",Am ori o nyalakan na so lima na ni Pite a patanken a kapanci na no aro a vao a mavakes a kano karwan da omraralay ni Yeso a somdep rana. So nipakacittan da rana si Tapitay a nimirwa a mavyay. 
1237249,And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. ,O akman rana sang a vazay am nimamizing da rana no tao do Yepey. Ori o nipeyparo da rana no tao a omanoyong ji Yeso do Yepey. 
1237250,"And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.",Si Pite rana am todavezed do dang a macivahay ji Simong. O vazay ni Simong am mapakapkapya so nihab da kolit no baka.
1237251,"There was a certain man in C&#230; sarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, ",Amyan so asa ka tao do Kaysadiya a ili a meyngaran si Kenaylyo a panirsirngen da no asa lipenpenan a itaysang do Itadi. 
1237252,"a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. ",Tana beken a tao do Yotay ori am manoyong o nakenakem na ji Ama ta do to a ka nira asa ka vahay. Rako o sidongan na so ji makahakaw a tao do Yotay a kasangib na meynozi ji Ama ta do to. 
1237253,"He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. ","Ipisa do makoyab do ikatlo no toki am nimapacita jya o asa ka tinsi ni Ama ta do to. Maniring am, ""Mo Kenaylyo."" "
1237254,"And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. ","To na nita o tinsi, ta ikamogaw na. Maniring am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, ikongo mo ipanci ang."" Maniring o tinsi am, ""Na imo manakem ni Ama do to, ta nimamizing na o inozi mo. Na katenngan o mo panidongan so ji makahakaw a tao. "
1237255,"And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter: ",Am ori o ipanovoy mo so tao a mangay do Yepey a manci no meyngaran so Simong Pite a mai. 
1237256,"he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. ","Yamyan do vahay ni Simong a mapakapkapya so nihab da kolit no baka. Yamasngen do pasalan o vahay da."" "
1237257,"And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; ","Karwan na rana no tinsi am ipanci ni Kenaylyo o rarwa ka lamlamsoy na mai a kano asa ka itaysang do Itadi a manoyong so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to, "
1237258,"and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.",kapanci na nya jira so ciring no tinsi a katovoy na sira mangay do Yepey.
1237259,"On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: ",Mararaw do ikadwa na araw am masngen rana sira do Yepey o nitovoy ni Kenaylyo. Si Pite rana am meynozi do atep no vahay da. 
1237260,"and he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, ",Makcin rana am naknakmen na o kakan na. Manotong pa sira am to ngyan so nipacita na jya ni Ama ta do to do akmey tateynep na. 
1237261,"and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: ",So nipakacita na so hanit a meywang a kakasan no akmey tontonen da milakayob do teyrahem. 
1237262,"wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. ",Do avak na am amyan so meycyamadadayan a omalalam a kano volay a kano meyyasasalap. 
1237263,"And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.","Amyan so meyzezyak a manci nya. Maniring am, ""Mo Pite, peytatanek rana kapanzakat mo so yakan mo."" "
1237264,"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. ","Am maniring si Pite am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, taosya, ta ji ko pa nikoman so sang, ta oya am ji namen ngangana a tao do Yotay."" "
1237265,"And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.","Maniring pa jya am, ""O ipanci ni Ama ta do to apya kanen am ji mo mancyan a ji ngangana an."" "
1237266,This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.,So nikeypitlo na makamizing sya makacita sya a kahap na rana sya ni Ama ta do to do teyngato.
1237267,"Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, ",Naknakmen na ni Pite do onowned na o peypeypangayan no nimacita na am to sira makaranes o nitovoy na ni Kenaylyo a tao do vahay ni Simong. 
1237268,"and called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. ","Maniring sira am, ""Yamyan so asa ka tao a meyngaran so Simong Pite a yamisan do jya?"""
1237269,"While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. ","Naknakmen na pa ni Pite o peypeypangayan no nimacita na ori am maniring jya o Seyzi am, ""Yamyan so yatatlo a ka tao a yakomala jimo. "
1237270,"Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. ","Meyhekas ka kapacihza mo jira. Ji mo a ratan, ta yaken o nitomovoy sira do jya."" "
1237271,"Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? ","Am ori o nipeyhekas na ni Pite. Maniring jira am, ""Yaken o nyo kalahen ang. Ikongo nyo ipanci."" "
1237272,"And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. ","Maniring sira am, ""Na nitovoy yamen ni Kenaylyo a panirsirngen da no asa lipenpenan a itaysang do Itadi. Iya rana am na iraralay si Ama ta do to.

1237273,"Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.",Am ori o nipasdepan na sira ni Pite a kapeysan na sira. Ikadwa na araw am macihza jira si Pite a kano tatasa akma ney kakteh do cinai a meyili do Yepey. 
1237274,"And the morrow after they entered into C&#230; sarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. ",Ikatlo na araw am makaranes rana sira do Kaysadiya. Am amyan rana do dang si Kenaylyo a kano zipozipos na kano kagakagagan na amnanala sya. 
1237275,"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. ",Somdep si Pite am mangay si Kenaylyo do tangain na kapeylilitod na amraralay nya. 
1237276,"But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. ","Maniring si Pite jya am, ""Peytatanek rana. Ji ka akman sang, ta meyyangay ta tao."" "
1237277,"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. ",So nipeysirisiring da somdep do vahay ni Kenaylyo. Meyratatang am macita na ni Pite o aro a tao a meylovolovot do sahad na. 
1237278,"And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. ","Maniring jira am, ""Nyo katenngan an, ta do iwawalam namen a tao do Yotay am ji namen a mya o kangay namen a komawalam jinyo a beken a tao do Yotay.

1237279,"Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? ","Am ori o ko na ji raci so ko kapacikaop jinyo do jya. Am ikongo nyo pancyan nyaken a mai do jya."""
1237280,"And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, ","Maniring si Kenaylyo am, ""Yakapat araw rana o hanga na no nipeynozi ko do vahay namen do ikatlo no toki do makoyab am to ngyan so asa ka tao a maniray so ayob a meytatanek do tangain ko. "
1237281,"and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. ","Maniring am, 'Mo Kenaylyo, na nimamizing ni Ama ta do to o inozi mo. Na katenngan imo a yamanidong so tao. "
1237282,"Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. ",So ipanovoy mo so tao a mangay do Yepey a manci no meyngaran si Simong Pite a mai. Iya rana am yamisan do vahay ni Simong a mapakapkapya so nihab da kolit no baka. Yamasngen do pasalan o vahay da.' 
1237283,"Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.","Am ori o nipanovoy ko so tao a manci nimo. Ko masaray, ta ka nimai rana. Yamen rana sicyaikwaya am namen malovot do tangain ni Ama ta do to a yaomamizing so nipanci na jimo a inanao na jyamen."""
1237284,"Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: ","Maniring si Pite am, ""Ko katenngan si Ama ta do to a mapeyyangangay so tao. "
1237285,"but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. ",Tana tao do Yotay a tana beken a tao do Yotay am miminen na sira ikaglaw o omraralay nya a tao a mangononong do ciring na. 
1237286,"The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) ","Nyo katenngan rana o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a nipeylimwang na jyamen a Isedi a tao. Ori rana am na ipanta yaten so ikapiya no onowned ta. So ikabo na rana no oyyan na nyaten ni Ama ta do to, ta nitovoy na si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen no tao do peycyamahamahatawan na. "
1237287,"that word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Jud&#230; a, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; ","Nyo na katenngan an, mateyka si Yowani a omononong do kapanaktak na am papwen na rana do Cyadidi a macinapnap do Yotay o keyyan no mapeyzokab a vazay. "
1237288,"how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. ","Nioyatan na no Seyzi si Yeso a tao do Nasale. So nilivolivon na mangiwakwak so meykeyngeyngen a tao a mamozwaw so kalamsoyan ni Satan a komovot do tao, do kapacikaop na jya ni Ama ta do to. "
1237289,"And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: ","Yamen rana am yongkad na, ta nimacita namen o vazay ni Yeso do Yelosaleng a kado peycyeylilyan na do Yotay. Nipadket da do jyojika si Yeso kawakwak na. "
1237290,"him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; ","Am ikatlo na araw am nivyay na ni Ama ta do to a kapacita na nya jyamen, "
1237291,"not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. ","a kapacihanghang namen jya koman no keypirwa na mavyay. Beken a mamimin o tao a nimakacita sya, ta yamen a nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to o nimakacita sya a meylimwang nya. "
1237292,"And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. ",Nipakoyokoy na jyamen o kapeylimwang namen no kanoyong na ni Yeso a nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to a mapacici so mavyay a kano nimawakwak a tao. 
1237293,"To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. ","Si Yeso o pakacirngan da so ciring da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to no kakwa. Ipanci da o ka si Yeso no makavonas so raraten no omanoyong jya tao."""
1237294,"While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. ",Mangononong si Pite am oyatan no Seyzi o omamizing so ciring na tao. 
1237295,"And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. ","Am ori o nipeyzokab da no tao do Yepey a omraralay ni Yeso a nimacihza ji Pite, ta nipanta na sira ni Ama ta do to so Seyzi o beken a tao do Yotay. "
1237296,"For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, ","Ta nimamizing da o kapeyzezyak da so macitarek a ciring a apo do Seyzi a somaray ni Ama ta do to. Maniring si Pite am, "
1237297,"Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? ","""Yana nioyatan sira no Seyzi akman jyaten. Am ori o ji ta raci sira taktakan."" "
1237298,And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.,So pancyan na nira ni Pite a mangozay do ngaran ni Yeso Kizisto a tomaktak jira.
1237299,And the apostles and brethren that were in Jud&#230; a heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. ,O nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na kano aro a sinjya do Yotay am mamizing da o beken a tao do Yotay a omanoyong rana do ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237300,"And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, ",Meysinaoli si Pite do Yelosaleng am nioya da no tey makdeng a omahap so iwawalam da no tao do Yotay. 
1237301,"saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. ","Maniring sira am, ""Ikongo o yamo nisan do vahay da no beken a tao do Yotay. Ikongo mo ipacihanghang jira."" "
1237302,"But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying, ",Karahan am ononongan na rana jira o niyapoyapwan no akman sang a vazay.
1237303,"I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me: ","Maniring jira am, ""Meynozi ko do Yepey am nimakacita ko so apo ji Ama ta do to a milakayob a tontonen da apo do teyngato.

1237304,"upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. ","Citahen ko am amyan do sahad na so meycyamadadayan a omalalam a kano volay a kano meyyasasalap, "
1237305,"And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.","a kapakamizing ko so macisirsiring jyaken. Maniring am, 'Mo Pite, peytatanek rana kapanzakat mo so yakan mo.' "
1237306,"But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth. ","Am maniring ko am, 'Mo Panirsirngen, taosya, ta ji ko nikoman so sang, ta ji namen ngangana ori a tao do Yotay.' "
1237307,"But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.","Pirwa na so kapanci na nya jyaken am maniring am, 'O ipanci ni Ama ta do to a apya kanen am ji mo mancyan a ji ngangana.' "
1237308,And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven. ,O akman rana sang a vazay am ipitlo a mavahangso a kahap da rana sya do hanit. 
1237309,"And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from C&#230; sarea unto me. ",Todey macinao sira makasasnad do nisanan ko a vahay o tatlo a ka beken a tao do Yotay a nitovoy da apo do Kaysadiya a nikomala jyaken. 
1237310,"And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house: ",So nipancyan na nyaken no Seyzi so kaji ko ratan so kapacihza ko jira. O ananem eya akma tey kakteh do cinai a mina kararay ko a nyo macita eya am nipehza ko sira jyaken a mangay do Kaysadiya kasdep namen do vahay da Kenaylyo. 
1237311,"and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter; ","Ipanci na jyamen ni Kenaylyo o nimacita na asa ka tinsi a nimeytatanek do vahay da. Maniring jya am, 'Manovoy ka so tao a mangay do Yepey a manci no asa ka tao a meyngaran si Simong Pite a mai jya. "
1237312,"who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved. ",Ta yamyan so na ipanci jinyo a omagaz do kapatazadang na jinyo do teyngato ni Ama ta do to a asa ka vahay.' 
1237313,"And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. ",Nanawen ko sira am to meyhekas jira o Seyzi akman no ka ori pa so kapeyhekas na jyaten no Seyzi. 
1237314,"Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.","Ori o nipakanakman ko so mina ciring na no Panirsirngen ta a si Yeso. Maniring am, 'Si Yowani rana am nitaktakan na inyo no ranom. Am do kadadayan no araraw am meyhekas jinyo o Seyzi.' "
1237315,"Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God? ","So nikanoyong ni Ama ta do to a yatomoro no Seyzi do beken a tao do Yotay, akman jyaten a nipanta na so Seyzi no kanoyong ta ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. A yako ikongo a kato ko makazazatan do vazay ni Ama ta do to."""
1237316,"When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.","Mamizing da o ciring na jira am ji da rana namwada, ta isaray da si Ama ta do to. Maniring sira am, ""Yamanoyong si Ama ta do to a yamarilaw no beken a tao do Yotay a nimamlis rana a na torwan no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da."""
1237317,"Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only. ",Wakwaken da si Setiven am peyvwaken da na o omraralay ni Yeso a tao. Am ori o nikarwan da do Yelosaleng a mangay tomayo do Vongnise a kado Saypolose a kado Antia a kapeylimwang da no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to do tao do Yotay. 
1237318,"And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus. ",Am o tatasa ka tao do Saypolose a pongso a kado Cidinay am nimangay sira do Antia a meylimwang no ciriciring ni Yeso do beken a Yotay. 
1237319,"And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.",Amyan jira o oyowyat ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o nipeyparo da no tao a omraralay ni Yeso. 
1237320,"Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch. ",Mamizing da no omraralay ni Yeso do Yelosaleng o akman sang a vazay am tovoin da si Parnapo a mangay do Antia. 
1237321,"Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord. ","Makaranes rana am tey masaray, ta nimacita na o aryarilaw na sira ni Ama ta do to. Ori o nipaitan na sira to ngotokot so nakenakem ji Yeso. "
1237322,"For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. ","Si Parnapo rana am tey yapya o nakenakem na, ta nioyatan no Seyzi. Am ori o ikakdeng na meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to. Ori nipeyparo da no tao a omanoyong ji Yeso."
1237323,"Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: ",Meyratateng am mangay rana si Parnapo do Tasose a komala si Sawlo. 
1237324,"and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.","Makala na rana am palolwen na mangay do Antia. So nipakasa kawan da macikaop do aro a sinjya amnanao sira. Nimacipinda no kano nang o kangaran da rana jira a ""omraralay ni Kizisto"" do Antia."
1237325,And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. ,No kanang rana am amyan so manoyonoyo so ciring ni Ama ta do to a apo do Yelosaleng a mangay do Antia. 
1237326,"And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius C&#230; sar. ","Amyan jira so asa ka tao a meyngaran si Acyapo. Maniring do aro a tao am, ""Nipaziman na jyaken no Seyzi o keyyan no omanam a rako a abcil do karawan."" (So nipangononong no ciring na no kapeypanirsirngen da si Kelawti.) "
1237327,"Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Jud&#230; a: ",Am ori o nikamimin da no amraralay ni Yeso a tao a mapeysinsinmo so nizpi a itoro da do akma dey kakteh do cinai a meyvahay do Yotay. To da palololwa do karwaro no nizpi da o panaoben da. 
1237328,"Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.",O nilovot da na nizpi am nipahanhan da si Parnapo a kani Sawlo a mangay nya do panipanirsirngen da do kyokay do Yelosaleng.
1237329,Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. ,"No kanang rana am nipakakasi na no panirsirngen da a meyngaran so Helote o omraralay ni Yeso a tao, "
1237330,And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. ,a kawakwak na sya no ipangan si Yake a kakteh na ni Yowani. 
1237331,"And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) ",Macita na sira o tao do Yotay a masaray no akman sang a vazay am mey na rakpen pa si Pite. No kanang am mamaring sira so kanen a koman so jya nimimway a pang. 
1237332,"And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. ","Marakep na si Pite am pasdepen na do pamemtengan a kapahanhan na so meykalsong a tomita sya. Amyan so meykapat a lipenpenan a teypapapat a mapalipalit a tomita sya. Ta naknakmen na ni Helote o kapacici na sya wakwaken do tangain no aro a tao, no mateyka rana sira mamaring so kanen do Iyeci. "
1237333,Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.,Am ori o to na peyyani pa si Pite do pamemtengan. So ikakdeng da no omraralay ni Yeso a meynozi nya.
1237334,"And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. ",Makasahep rana a kapowbot na si Pite ni Helote a pacicin a wakwaken am mitkeh si Pite do panavavakan da no rarwa meykalsong a mavaod no adwa ka vahalang. O pazevngen am amyan dang so mamzat a meykalsong. 
1237335,"And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. ","Am to ngyan so asa ka tinsi ni Ama ta do to a meytatanek. So nicirayan na so pamemtengan a kapinan na do pakaw na ni Pite a yokain. Maniring am, ""Kayokay rana."" Meyratateng am mina todazavat do lima na ni Pite o nivaod da sya. "
1237336,"And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. ","Maniring pa o tinsi jya am, ""Peyyabtek rana kapeytokap mo."" Karahan am meyyabtek rana kapeytokap na ni Pite. Maniring jya o tinsi am, ""Peytalili rana o magorogod mo a kapacihza mo jyaken."" "
1237337,"And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.","So nionotan na jya ni Pite a makowbot do pamemtengan. Am ji na tenngi o kanoyong na no vazay na no tinsi, ta ipanci na tateynep na. "
1237338,"When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. ","Peyliktawan da o manmanma mamzat a kano ikararwa na am makaranes rana sira do niparing da vahalang a pangengneban a macimingket do ili da. Mina todeywangi. Am ori o nipakowbotan da rana mangonong do asa ka rarahan. Am to na nangpawa ni Pite o tinsi, do kabo na rana do katangked na."
1237339,"And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.","Katenngan na rana ni Pite am maniring am, ""Ko na katenngan sicyaikwaya o na kanoyong ni Ama ta do to a nimapahanhan so tinsi na a omahap jyaken a komaro do ahapan na so inawan ko ni Helote a kano peymetdehan da jyaken no aro a tao do Yotay."""
1237340,"And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying. ","Am ori o nyangay na do vahay da Madiya, ina na ni Yowani Make. Do dang rana am kalwalovotan da a meynozi nya. "
1237341,"And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. ",Pokpoken na o pazevngen ni Pite am makowbot o asa ka mavakes a lamlamsoy da a meyngaran so Lota. 
1237342,"And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. ","Katovilan na o izezyak na ni Pite am masaray. Am ori o nyangay na do karwan da. Maniring am, ""Yamyan si Pite do pantaw."" "
1237343,"And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. ","Maniring sira jya am, ""Ka zomyak ang."" Am ji na ablisi o ipanci na. Maniring pa sira jya am, ""Ala pahad na ori ni Pite."" "
1237344,"But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished. ",So nikownay ni Pite do pantaw. Iwangan da am manoyong a si Pite. Am ori o nipeyzokaban da nya. 
1237345,"But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.","Kasdep na ni Pite am patalahen na o lima na. Maniring jira am, ""Ji kamo meyzezyak, ta ononongan ko na o panpandan no na nipasawayan jyaken ni Ama ta do to do pamemtengan."" Maniring pa jira am, ""Ipanci nyo pa ji Yake a kano akma nyoy kakteh do cinai."" Teyka na ononongan ni Pite o cinasasaodan na am mangay rana do asa ka ili."
1237346,"Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. ","Pezak rana am ikazyak da no aro a meykalsong, ta ji da tenngi o nyangayan ni Pite. "
1237347,"And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Jud&#230; a to C&#230; sarea, and there abode.","Am ori o nipancyan na nira ni Helote a komala sya. Am ji da kala. Karahan am pacicin na sira o aro a mamzamzat. Maniring jira am, ""Nyo nikongo ori ang."" Am abo o asa ka tao a mapasapa jya. Meyoyaoya am to rana manovoy so tao a amzakat sira. Meyratateng am karwan na rana ni Helote o Yotay a mangay a meyvahay do Kaysadiya."
1237348,"And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country. ","No kanang am nimakdeng si Helote a nimwoya no tao do Tayar a kado Siton. Am ori o nyangay da ji Polaseto a mapasyasi jya somidong sira macisirsiring ji Helote, ta si Polaseto rana am tomalamozong no vahay na ni Helote. Am ori o nipacihza na jira a mangay ji Helote a mapeyyalalap so nakem da ji Helote. Ta o kanekanen da am apo do ili ni Helote."
1237349,"And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. ",O araw no nipancyan na nira am meyyaywayob rana so ayob no panirsirngen amlisna do lilisnan no panirsirngen a kapangononong na do aro a tao. 
1237350,"And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. ","Mamizing da o ciring na am amlololos o aro a tao. Maniring sira am, ""Beken a izezyak no tao ya, ta izezyak no tao do to."" "
1237351,"And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.","Nikakza na ni Helote o kararalay da nya no tao. Meyratateng am mina to meyhekas o tinsi ni Ama ta do to ambakbak jya, ta ji na azwazwaya si Ama ta do to. Am ori o nipanmanma na a nimowwed a kazakat na rana."
1237352,But the word of God grew and multiplied. ,Ori rana o nipeylimwang no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to do dang.
1237353,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.",Mateyka da rana o vazay da da Parnapo a kani Sawlo do Yelosaleng am palolwen da si Yowani Make a kapeysinaoli da do Antia.
1237354,"Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. ",O kyokay do Antia am amyan so panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a kano mangnanao a tao. Sira rana am si Parnapo a kani Simoyang a ngaranan da si Vaheng a kano tao do Cidinay a meyngaran so Lociye a kani Manaeng a nipavahay ni ama na ni Helote a panirsirngen do Cyadidi a kani Sawlo. 
1237355,"As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. ","No kararalay da ni Ama ta do to a ji mangakaday am maniring jira o Seyzi am, ""Pamnekan nyo si Parnapo a kani Sawlo a mapeyvazay so vazay ko."" "
1237356,"And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.",Mateyka sira meynozi a ji mangakaday am paoptahen da o lima da ji Parnapo a kani Sawlo a ipowyat da sira do vazay da katovoy da rana sira mangay do peycyeylilyan na.
1237357,"So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. ",Nipahanhan na no Seyzi si Parnapo a kani Sawlo. Am ori o niosok da mangay do Silyoci a kavang da do avang a mangay do Saypolose a pongso. 
1237358,"And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.",Makaranes sira do Salami a ili am ipeylimwang da o ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to do aro a peyneynozyan da no tao do Yotay. No kanang am nimacihza jira si Yowani Make a somidong sira do vazay da.
1237359,"And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus: ",Nilivolivon da o pongso do Saypolose. Makaranes sira do Pavo a ili am masazi da dang o asa ka tao do Yotay a meyngaran so Pa-Yeso a mamnek a tao. Ipanci na o kataotao na a panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to. Am malas ori. 
1237360,"which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. ","Kagagan na o mateneng a panirsirngen no Saypolose a meyngaran si Secyo Pawlo. Nipanci na si Parnapo a kani Sawlo a mai, ta kakzeben na o kamizing na so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. "
1237361,"But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.",Am ji na nipya no mamnek a tao. (O ngaran na do Sila am si Idima.) Ta naknakmen na o kazazat na jya a omanoyong ji Yeso. 
1237362,"Then Saul, (who also is called Paul, ) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him, ",No kanang rana am nioyatan no Seyzi si Sawlo. (Mamlis rana am meyngaran so Pawlo.) Ori o mina to na pasilapi jya a citahen. 
1237363,"and said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? ","Maniring jya am, ""Imo rana ya am kamo meyyangay so nakenakem a kani Satan a yaji ngahap so vazay ni Ama ta do to, do mo kapanlita a yaomalalas do ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. "
1237364,"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. ","So ipeydedna na jimo no peyoyaoyyan ni Ama ta do to. So ikownay mo a mavota ji makacita so araw."" Makarahan am jya nimeyyahahay si Idima a masari so citahen a kavota na rana. So nipeykazakazazap na meykala so tao a komalay sya. "
1237365,"Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.","Macita na ni Secyo Pawlo o akman sang a vazay am anoyngan na rana si Yeso, do kapeyzokab na no oyowyat no ipangnanao da a omagaz ji Yeso."
1237366,"Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.",Meyratateng am mavang sira Pawlo do avang a apo do Pavo a mangay do Peyke a ili a macinapnap do Pangveydiya. Makaranes sira do dang am karwan na sira ni Yowani Make a kapeysinaoli na mangay do Yelosaleng. 
1237367,"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down. ",Am sira Pawlo a kani Parnapo am to sira meysosonong a mangay do asa ka ili a meyngaran so Antia a macinapnap do Pisitiya. O araw na no ipeywalam no tao am mangay sira do peyneynozyan a omamizing so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237368,"And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.","Mateyka na vilangan no asa ka tao o nivatvatkan ni Moyse a kano nivatvatkan no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to am manovoy o panipanirsirngen no peyneynozyan so tao a mapacici sira. Maniring am, ""Inyo rana yararwa am si myan so ipait nyo jyamen am ipanci nyo an."""
1237369,"Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience. ","Ori nipeytatanek ni Pawlo a mapatala so lima na. Maniring am, ""Inyo rana Isedi a tao a ka ninyo a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to am amizngen nyo an. "
1237370,"The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. ",O Tao do to ta Isedi a tao am na nipamnekan o ineynapo ta amraralay nya. No keyyan da do beken a ili da do Ayci am nipasaod na sira. Meyratateng am agagen na sira no oyowyat na a komaro dang. 
1237371,And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness. ,No keyyan da pa do kabwan no nihakawan no tao so sikapat a ngarnan (40) so awawan am tana ji da ngamiznga si Ama ta do to am apzatan na sira. 
1237372,"And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot. ","Am ori o nibalinasan da so apito a ka ili do Cyanan, ta nisidong na sira no oyowyat na katoro na nya jira so ili da. No kangay da do Ayci a mangay no keyyan da rana do Cyanan am sikalima o ikasikalima na poo (450) no awawan na."
1237373,"And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. ","""Meyratateng am ipamnek na sira so mapalipalit a amyokod nira mangay no kapeypanirsirngen na ni Samoar. Iya rana am panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to. "
1237374,"And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. ",No kanang am ikakza da o keyyan no asa ka panirsirngen da. So nipamnekan na ji Sawlo anak ni Cise sivovoong ni Penyaming a meypanirsirngen so sikapat a ngarnan (40) so awawan. 
1237375,"And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.","Pakarwen na ni Ama ta do to si Sawlo am pamnekan na si Tawey a panirsirngen da. Maniring si Ama ta do to am, 'Yako ikaglaw si Tawey anak ni Yesi, ta na miminen o vazay ko ahapen.' "
1237376,"Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus: ",Si Tawey rana am ineynapo na ni Yeso a nitovoy ni Ama ta do to a mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato a sivosivovoong ni Isedi. Ta ori o nipanci na no kakwa pa ni Ama ta do to. 
1237377,when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. ,No kaji na pa mangnanawan ni Yeso am nimanma rana si Yowani a mapaziman so Isedi a tao a komaro do peyraratenan da kataktak na jira. 
1237378,"And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose. ","Makeykai rana o vazay ni Yowani a komavos am ipanci na jira. Maniring am, 'Nyo katenngan yaken an? Yaken rana am beken a mapatazadang jinyo do teyngato a nyo pananalahen a mai. Ta yamyan pa so yamai a maizaizay pa ka nyaken. So ikabo no pacicingayan ko jya a omovay so iktan no tokap na.'"""
1237379,"Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. ","Maniring pa jira si Pawlo am, ""Manga kakteh a sivosivovoong na ni Apolahan a ka ninyo a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to a beken a tao do Yotay, yaten o nipeylimwangan na no ciriciring a omagaz do kapatazadang na jyaten do teyngato ni Ama ta do to. "
1237380,"For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. ","Am o yameyvahay do Yelosaleng a tao a kano panipanirsirngen da am da jyatenngi si Yeso a nitovoy ni Ama ta do to a mapatazadang jyaten.

So nipangononong no mina ciring da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to, do mina kapanci da ni Yeso a wakwaken. "
1237381,"And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. ",Tana ji da kala o karatan na izakat da sya am pakotokoten da ji Pilato o kazakat da sya. 
1237382,"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. ",Mangononong rana o nivatvatkan do Seysyo a omagaz ji Yeso am akasen da rana do jyojika kapakakasa da sya do heseb na. 
1237383,But God raised him from the dead: ,Am nivyay na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237384,"and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.","O mina kararay na apo do Cyadidi a mangay do Yelosaleng am nimacita da si Yeso a nimirwa a mavyay do sikapat a ngarnan (40) so araraw. Sira ori nimeylimwang ni Yeso jyaten a tao do Yotay, do kanimakacita da sya. "
1237385,"And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. ","Sicyaraw rana ya am namen ipeylimwang jinyo o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. O nipanci na pa ni Ama ta do to do ineynapo ta am yana nimangononong jyaten an.

Maniring am, 'Imo am Anak ko imo an. So peylimwangan ko nimo sicyaraw eya do yamo kapeyyama jyaken.'"
1237386,"And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. ","Si Ama ta do to rana a nimapeyvangon sya do heseb na a ji mamyapya nya mirwa a mawakwak am maniring am, 'To ko peynara ji Tawey o aryarilaw ko jinyo.'"
1237387,"Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. ","Maniring pa si Tawey do nivatvatkan a Anwanood am, 'Mo ji mamyapyan o kataotao no nipamnekan mo a tao a macirapa do tana.'"
1237388,"For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: ",No kapeyigegen na pa ni Tawey am aro mina vazay na ji Ama ta do to. Mawakwak am patangkeden da o heseb na do heseb da no ineynapo na. So nipacirapa no kataotao na do tana. 
1237389,"but he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.","Am si Yeso am jya nimakman so sang o kataotao na, ta nivyay na ni Ama ta do to. "
1237390,"Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. ","Manga kakteh, naknakmen nyo an. No si ji nyo meyhanhanan si Yeso am jyavonas o raraten nyo. O iwawalam na ni Moyse am ji na agag inyo do peyraratenan nyo an.

O iwawalam na ni Moyse am ji na agag inyo do peyraratenan nyo an. Am yaomanoyong ji Yeso a tao am oyatan na sira a komaro do peyraratenan da. "
1237391,"Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;","Am ori o apzatan nyo do onowned nyo. Ta meydedna jinyo o peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to a domket do vakong da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to. Maniring sira am, "
1237392,"Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: For I work a work in your days, A work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.","'Inyo a yamangolala a tao am amizngen nyo an. Amyan so macita nyo a ikanyahey nyo a vazay a pasingsingtan ko jinyo. Tana yamyan so tao a mapaziman sya jinyo am nyo ji nganoyngi.'"""
1237393,"And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. ","Mateyka rana mangononong si Pawlo am karwan da rana kani Parnapo o peyneynozyan. Maniring sira o niomamizing sya a tao am, ""Si ipisa kapeywalam no tao am mai kamo pa omnanao jyamen."" "
1237394,"Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.",Meysyasyay rana sira am aro tao a macilolo ji Pawlo a kani Parnapo. Ipait da sira a to ngotokot so nakem a meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to a yasomidong sira. Sira rana am tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay a mahap rana so iwawalam no tao do Yotay.
1237395,And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God. ,Ipisa kapeywalam no tao am mamimin sira o tao a nimangay a omamizing so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237396,"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.",Am macita da no tao do Yotay o karo da no meylovolovot a tao am ikeynanahet da sira. Am ori o rehrehtan da si Pawlo a kano ciriciring na. 
1237397,"Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. ","Am ikakdekdeng ni Pawlo a kani Parnapo a meyzezyak a omnanao sira. Maniring sira am, ""O ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am nimanma kamo a peylimwangan nya. Am nyo kaji nganoyngan jya. Nyo to nazibwan o na kapanta ninyo ni Ama ta do to so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad nyo. Am ori o namen karwan rana jinyo a mangay do beken a tao do Yotay. "
1237398,"For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.","Ta yamyan so na nipakolivava rana jyamen ni Ama ta do to a ciring na. Maniring jyamen am, 'Ko na nipamnekan inyo a akma dey zezngang no beken a tao do Yotay. Ipeylimwang nyo do peycyamahamahatawan na o kapatazadang ko sira do teyngato.'"""
1237399,"And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. ","Mamizing da no beken a tao do Yotay am masaray sira. Ori o nyazwazwayan da so ciring na ni Ama ta do to. Sira rana aro a tao am nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to o kapamnek na jira a mahap so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da, do kanoyong da rana ji Yeso."
1237400,And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. ,So nikamimin da rana do peycyeylilyan na makamizing so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237401,"But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. ",Am pasozisozin da no tao do Yotay o maizay a mahakay a kano meynakem a mavakes a omraralay ni Ama ta do to a mapakakasi si Pawlo a kani Parnapo. Ori o nipowbotan da sira do ili da. 
1237402,"But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. ",Am ori o nitoktokan da so tana do ai da da Pawlo a kani Parnapo a itovil da jira meyraraten a ji mamlis so nakenakem. Meyratateng am karwan da rana sira a mangay do Ikenyan. 
1237403,"And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.",Masasaray sira o amraralay ni Yeso a tao do Antia do kowyat na jira no Seyzi.
1237404,"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. ",Makaranes si Pawlo a kani Parnapo do Ikenyan a ili am mangay sira do peyneynozyan da no tao do Yotay a mangnanao. So nikaro no tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay a omanoyong rana ji Yeso. 
1237405,"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren. ",Am o jyakey a manganoyong a tao do Yotay am pasozisozin da sira o beken a tao do Yotay a macioya do amraralay ni Yeso. 
1237406,"Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. ",Am mownay pa dang si Pawlo a kani Parnapo. Ji sira nimamogaw a meylimwang ni Yeso. Ta nioyatan na sira ni Ama ta do to. Am aro o mapeyzokab a vazay da yongkad no ipeylimwang da pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237407,"But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. ",So nipeypinpin da no tao do dang. O asa lipenpenan am macikagom do tao do Yotay. O asa lipenpenan am macyagom da Pawlo a kani Parnapo a omanoyong do nanao da.
1237408,"And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, ",Am o tao do Yotay a kano panipanirsirngen da kano kararay da beken a tao do Yotay am naknakmen da o kapaciliman da ji Pawlo a kani Parnapo a agsagsahan. 
1237409,"they were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: ","Mamizing ni Pawlo a kani Parnapo am somazok sira do Disetela kado Tepey a ili a macinapnap do Dikawniya kado macisngen dang a ili, "
1237410,and there they preached the gospel.,kapeylimwang da dang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to.
1237411,"And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: ",Amyan do Disetela so asa ka mahakay a nimeycicinda a ji makalam no katazak na tao. 
1237412,"the same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, ",Amizngen na o ipangnanao na ni Pawlo am to na ningkaji ni Pawlo. Milamdam na ni Pawlo a meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to am iwakwakan na. 
1237413,"said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.","Maniring jya am, ""Peytatanek rana,"" a kapeytatanek na rana omalam. "
1237414,"And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. ","Macita da o vazay ni Pawlo no aro a tao am amlololos sira meyzezyak so ciriciring no Dikawniya a ji da tenngi a amizngen da Pawlo. Maniring sira am, ""Asyo sira ya yakmey mina to meyhekas a tao do to."" "
1237415,"And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. ","Karahan am ngaranan da sira no ngaran no tao do to da. O ningaran da ji Parnapo am si Sose. Si Pawlo am si Hemeyse, ta iya o meyzezyak. "
1237416,"Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. ",Amyan do siri no ili da so raralayan da ni Sose. No kanang amyan so asa ka tao a mapatanatanang so pazos da mangalak so baka meytaktakzes so savong no kayo a mangay do samorangan no ili da a amzakat so baka a omraralay ni Pawlo a kani Parnapo.
1237417,"Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, ","Milamdam na ni Parnapo a kani Pawlo o nakenakem da no aro a tao am marahet o onowned da. Am ori o nizamitan da so talili da kangay da do tangain da no aro a tao. Maniring sira am, "
1237418,"and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: ","""Ikongo nyo icyakman so sang so vazay jyamen. Namen akman jinyo saon a tao am. O namen nyai jya am namen ipeylimwang jinyo o Mapasaray a Ciriciring ni Yeso. Namen ikakza inyo a komaro do ji meyngongyod a iraralay nyo. Apyapya pa o kararalay nyo no manoyong a Tao do to. Iya rana am nimangamamaog so karawan a kano meycyamadadayan. "
1237419,who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. ,No kakwa pa am nipya na inyo a beken a tao do Yotay a to ngonongonong do nakenakem nyo. 
1237420,"Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. ","Am yaro makakaday a yapya vazay na yongkad na jinyo a yamarilaw ninyo. Na ipanta inyo so cimoy. Na nipasaod o mowamowa nyo. Na absoin inyo. Na pasarain o onowned nyo."" "
1237421,"And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.",Tana ipeypanci da Pawlo o ka beken a tao do to da am ji sira aza o taotao a omraralay nira.
1237422,"And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. ",Am o tao do Yotay a nimapo do Ikenyan a kado Antia a macinapnap do Pisitiya am paksozen da o aro a tao a kagsegseh da ji Pawlo. Ipanci da nimazakat rana. Am ori o nilolwan da sya yangay do siri no ili da. 
1237423,"Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.",Limoten da no amraralay ni Yeso a tao am to meytatanek a meyvangon a kangay na rana do ili da. Ikadwa na araw am mangay rana sira kani Parnapo do Tepey.
1237424,"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, ",Makaranes sira do Tepey am ipeylimwang da o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o nipeyparo da no tao a omanoyong rana ji Yeso. Meyratateng am meysinaoli rana sira mangay do Disetela kado Ikenyan a kado Antia ili a macinapnap do Pisitiya. 
1237425,"confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. ","So nikakadayan da so amraralay ni Yeso a tao a paiten so nakem a to ngotokot a amraralay ni Ama ta do to. Maniring sira jira am, ""Yaten rana a yamraralay ni Yeso am aro masapa ta alalaw no macikaop ta do italamozong na ni Ama ta do to."" "
1237426,"And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.",Meyratateng am mamnek sira so panipanirsirngen da do peycyakyokyokayan na a madaday do teyhesa ka ili. Ji sira mangakaday a meynozi nira ji Ama ta do to.
1237427,"And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. ",Mangay rana sira am meyhatay sira do Pisitiya. Mownay am makaranes sira do Pangveydiya. 
1237428,"And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia: ",So nipangnanao da do Peyke. Meyratateng am meypangay sira do Atadiya. 
1237429,"and thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. ",Komavos rana o vazay da do dang am somakay sira do avang a meysinaoli do Antia. Ta do dang nipamnekan na jira ni Ama ta do to a mahap so vazay na. So nikavos na rana no vazay da. 
1237430,"And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. ",Makaranes rana sira do Antia am lovoten da sira o sinjya a kapanci da nya jira so nisidongan na sira ni Ama ta do to do vazay da. Ta o ipeylimwang da do tao a ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am nyanoyngan da no beken a tao do Yotay. 
1237431,And there they abode long time with the disciples.,So nikownay da dang da Pawlo a kani Parnapo a macikaop do akma dey kakteh do cinai do Antia.
1237432,"And certain men which came down from Jud&#230; a taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. ","Amyan so tao a apo do Yotay a nimai do Antia a omnanao so sinjya do dang. Maniring sira am, ""No si ji nyo mangozai o iwawalam na ni Moyse a amyongkad do kataotao nyo a meyngongyod a Isedi am ji na patazadanga inyo ni Ama ta do to do teyngato."" "
1237433,"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. ",Si Pawlo a kani Parnapo am nimakdeng sira nimacigalagal jira do akman sang a malas a nanao. Am ori o nipamnekan da ji Pawlo a kani Parnapo a kano tatasa ka sinjya a mangay do Yelosaleng a macisirsiring nya do nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na kano panipanirsirngen do kyokay.
1237434,"And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.","Meyratateng am tovoin da rana sira no akma dey kakteh do cinai a mangay. So nyangay da tomazogaw no sinjya do Vongnise a kado Samadiya. Maniring sira jira am, ""Yaro rana o beken a tao do Yotay a yarana omanoyong ji Yeso."" Mamizing da ori am masaray sira."
1237435,"And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. ",Makaranes rana sira do Yelosaleng am taotawwen da sira no akma dey kakteh do cinai a kano panipanirsirngen da do kyokay a kano nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na. So niononongan da jya da Pawlo a kani Parnapo so nisidongan na sira ni Ama ta do to do vazay da.
1237436,"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.","Maniring o tatasa ka amraralay ni Yeso a tao a macyagom do Vadisay am, ""Jyabo kaji da yongkadan do kataotao da no beken a tao do Yotay a mangozay do iwawalam ni Moyse a."""
1237437,And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. ,Meyratateng am peysirisiring da no nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na kano panipanirsirngen da do kyokay o ciring da no tao a macyagom do Vadisay. 
1237438,"And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. ","So nikownay da nimeysirisiring. Meyratateng am meytatanek si Pite. Maniring jira am, ""Manga kakteh, nyo katenngan yaken a na nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to a mangay a mapamizing so beken a tao do Yotay no Mapasaray a Ciriciring. "
1237439,"And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; ","Si Ama ta do to rana am katenngan na o onowned no tao. So nitorwan na no Seyzi do beken a tao do Yotay, akman jyaten a nitorwan na nya, "
1237440,"and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. ","pacittan na no kapeyyangangay na jyaten a patazadangen do teyngato. Na nivonas o raraten da no beken a tao do Yotay, do da kanoyong rana ji Yeso. "
1237441,"Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? ",Nyo ileylamdamen si Ama ta do to? Nyo pancyan no kamimin no iwawalam ta tao do Yotay a ahapen da no yamraralay ni Yeso a beken a tao do Yotay? To ko na macitangain jinyo am ji da nimataptap no ineynapo ta o iwawalam ni Moyse a pangozayan. 
1237442,"But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.","Yaten rana am meyyangay ta kano beken a tao do Yotay a patazadangen ni Ama ta do to do teyngato, do ta kapeyhanhan no pangangarilawan na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta."""
1237443,"Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.","So ikabo no meykazyazyak a tao a omamizing so ononongan ni Parnapo a kani Pawlo, do kapeyzokab da no vazay da do beken a tao do Yotay, ta nisidong na sira ni Ama ta do to."
1237444,"And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: ","Mateyka sira a mangononong am meyzezyak si Yake. Maniring am, ""Manga kakteh, amizngen nyo an. "
1237445,"Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. ",O nipanci ni Simong Pite no kacitai ori am na nipanci o kanimamnek na ni Ama ta do to do beken a tao do Yotay a omanoyong jya. 
1237446,"And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, ","O akman sang a vazay am mina todey mangononong do nivatvatkan da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to no kakwa. Maniring am, "
1237447,"After this I will return, And will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; And I will build again the ruins thereof, And I will set it up:",'No makwa am meysinaoli ko pa a mapatnek so yakma raney nimazkem a vahay ni Tawey.
1237448,"That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, Saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.",Ta ori o ikamimin da omanop jyaken no nipamnekan ko a beken a tao do Yotay.
1237449,Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.,"Ori rana am ciring na ni Ama ta do to a nipamizing na jira no kakwa pa.'"""
1237450,"Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: ","Maniring pa si Yake am, ""O nakenakem ko am taosya o kapeyparo ta so vazay da no yarana amraralay ni Ama ta do to a beken a tao do Yotay. "
1237451,"but that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. ",Apyapya pa o kapeyteygami ta nira a manci no kaji da nganan so nipazos da. Taosya o kapangzakza da so icyatatao da. Taosya o kakan da so rala no vinyay a kano nivitkeh da vinyay a nimazakat a jya nimvoyog so rala. 
1237452,"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.","Ta nimakalapo no kakwa do ipeywalam no tao o keyyan no tao do peyneynozyan amvilang do iwawalam ni Moyse. So na icyakman sang do peycyeylilyan na a yada ipeylimwang do tao."""
1237453,"Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: ",No kanang am mamnek sira o nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na kano panipanirsirngen do kyokay a kano amraralay ni Yeso a tao so pahanhanen da macihza ji Pawlo a kani Parnapo a mangay do Antia. So nipamnekan da ji Sila kani Yota. O kasaing no ngaran ni Yota am si Pasapa. Ikanig da sira ori no akma dey kakteh do cinai. 
1237454,and they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: ,"O peypeypangayan no domket a ciring do teygami ori am:"" Kokay kamo akma nameney kakteh do cinai a beken a tao do Yotay a yamyan do Antia ka ninyo a yamyan do Sidiya ka ninyo a yamyan do Cidicya. Yamen a kakteh nyo a nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na kano panipanirsirngen do kyokay am namen meyteygami jinyo. "
1237455,"forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment: ",Namen nimamizing sira o yatatasa ka tao a mangononong so malas a yanyo ikarahet so onowned. Am yabo o asa ka tao a namen nitovoy. 
1237456,"it seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, ","Am ori o namen nipeysirsirngan nya no kapanovoy namen so mangay jinyo do dang. So da ipacihza ji Parnapo a kani Pawlo a akma tey kakteh do cinai, "
1237457,men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. ,ta sira rana am da ji hawan o inawan da a mahap so vazay ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. 
1237458,"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. ",O namen nipamnekan rana am si Yota kani Sila. Sira o namen hanhan a manci no ciring namen do teygami eya. 
1237459,"For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; ",Ta namen ipeyhanhan o Seyzi a macyanoyong jyamen a ji mapeyparo so vazay nyo. O makekdeng rana a ciring o itoro namen jinyo a pangozayan nyo. 
1237460,"that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.","Taosya o kakan nyo so nipazos da. Taosya o kakan nyo so rala no vinyay a kano nivitkeh da vinyay a nimazakat a jya nimvoyog so rala. Taosya o kapangzakza nyo so icyatatao nyo.

1237461,"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: ",Mangay rana sira o nipamnekan da do Antia am lovoten da rana sira o yamraralay ni Yeso a katoro da no teygami da jira. 
1237462,"which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. ","Vilangan da rana o teygami da jira am masasaray sira, ta apiya o ciring da ipait da sira. "
1237463,"And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. ",Si Yota kani Sila am mateneng sira mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o ikaro no ciriciring da ipowyat da so onowned da no akma dey kakteh do cinai. 
1237464,"And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. ",So nikownay da dang a nimiseysan. Mangay rana sira am taitaiden da sira no akma dey kakteh do cinai a meysinaoli rana do Yelosaleng. 
1237465,Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. ,[Am si Sila am mina todavezed do dang.]
1237466,"Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.",Si Pawlo a kani Parnapo am amyan pa sira do Antia amnanao so tao a meylimwang ni Yeso. So nikaro no mina kararay da somidong sira do vazay da.
1237467,"And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do. ",Kadadayan na rana do araraw am ipanci na ni Pawlo ji Parnapo o kapeysinaoli da do aro a ili a nipeylimwangan da rana no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a tomita so akma dey kakteh do cinai. 
1237468,"And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. ",Naknakmen na ni Parnapo si Yowani Make a palolwen da macihza jira. 
1237469,"But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. ",Am ji na mya ni Pawlo. Ta no keypisa am jya nimakey a macihza jira si Yowani Make. Am ori o nipacisyay na jira do Pangveydiya. 
1237470,"And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; ",Am ori o ji da nimacipasovoi do vazay da. Karahan am to sira meysyay rana. Si Parnapo rana am nipalolo na si Make a mavang do avang a mangay do Saypolose a pongso. 
1237471,"and Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.",Si Pawlo rana am nipamnekan na si Sila a macihza jya. Karwan da sira o akma dey kakteh do cinai am ipeynozi da sira ji Ama ta do to a omzat jira. 
1237472,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.",So nilivonan da so peycyeylilyan na do Sidiya kado Cidicya a mapait so onowned da no akma dey kakteh do cinai.
1237473,"Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: ",Mangay sira do Tepey a kado Disetela am amyan dang so asa ka tao a amraralay ni Yeso a meyngaran si Timotay. O ina na am tao do Yotay a amraralay ni Yeso. Am o ama na am tao do Sila. 
1237474,which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. ,Ikanig da si Timotay no akma dey kakteh do cinai do Disetela kado Ikenyan. 
1237475,Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek. ,"Palolwen na ni Pawlo si Timotay am yongkadan na o kataotao na no iwawalam no tao do Yotay, ta panadnaden na o tao do dang a makateneng ji ama na a beken a tao do Yotay. "
1237476,"And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. ",Omrateng sira do peycyeylilyan na am ipanci da o mina kaygi da do Yelosaleng no nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na kano panipanirsirngen do kyokay do dang a panginginaran da. 
1237477,"And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.",Am ori o nipeypahagnat da so onowned do peycyakyokyokayan na. So nipangday da so araraw a meyparo no omanoyong rana ji Yeso a tao.
1237478,"Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, ","Ikongo do ji na mya sira no Seyzi a mangay a meylimwang no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to do Yasiya, am ori o nipangonong da do Vodicya kado Cyalatay. "
1237479,"after they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not. ",Makaranes sira do Misiya am naknakmen da o kangay da do Potiniya a ili. Am ji na mya sira no Seyzi. 
1237480,And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. ,Am ori o to da hatasi so Misiya a kangay da do Teloya. 
1237481,"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. ","Mahep rana am amyan so nipacita na ji Pawlo ni Ama ta do to, do akma ney tateynep. Macita na do akmey tateynep o asa ka tao do Maciton a meytatanek a mapasyasi jya. Maniring am, ""Mai kamo do Maciton a somidong jyamen."" "
1237482,"And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.",Macita na ni Pawlo o akmey tateynep am ori o nikakeykai namen rana a nimangay do Maciton. Ta katenngan namen si Ama ta do to a manci nyamen a mangay meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na do tao do dang.
1237483,"Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; ",Nimavang namen do avang do Teloya kapasongay da sya mangay do Samotake. Ikadwa na araw am makaranes namen do Niyapodi. 
1237484,"and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. ",So nyangay namen do rako a ili do Maciton a meyngaran so Veydipi. O ili ori am italamozong no Loma. So niseysan namen dang. 
1237485,"And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.","Ipeywalam no tao am mangay namen do ayo do siri no ili da, ta nimamizing namen do dang o angayan da meynozi no tao do Yotay. Makaranes namen dang am nanawen namen sira o aro a mavakes a nimalovot dang. "
1237486,"And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. ","Amyan jira ang so asa ka mavakes apo do Tiyatila a meyngaran si Ditiya. O vazay na am macinginangina no masingat a akmey nikowpasan a vangkoro a milakayob. Makdeng o nakenakem na ji Ama ta do to. Mamizing na o ipangnanao ni Pawlo a ciring ni Yeso am mina todeywangi o onowned na, do kanisomidong na sya ni Ama ta do to. "
1237487,"And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.","Teyka namen a taktakan o mavakes ori a kano macivahay jya tao am maniring jyamen am, ""No si milamdam nyo yaken so onowned a yameyngongyod a omanoyong ji Yeso am mai kamo a misan do vahay ko an."" So nitaidan na jyamen a peysanen."
1237488,"And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: ","Ipisa am mangay namen do ayo a meynozi am amyan so nimasinmo namen do rarahan a mavakes a lamlamsoy da. Mahaw na o vazay no makwa, ta nikovotan no kalamsoyan ni Satan. So ikaro no mahap na nizpi a itoro do mapeylamlamsoy sya a tao. "
1237489,"The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. ","So to na maciloloi jyamen do rarahan a amlololos. Maniring am, ""Sira rana ya am da ahapen o vazay no ney manokdwan na Tao do to. Yada ipeylimwang o Tao do to a mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato."" "
1237490,"And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.","Mangday do araraw a amlololos. Ikarahet na ni Pawlo am to meyvazingowngaw a tomita sya. Maniring do nikomovot jya am, ""Ko pangozayan o ngaran na ni Yeso Kizisto a manci nimo a makowbot rana do kataotao na."" Am ori o nipakowbot na rana no nikomovot jya."
1237491,"And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers, ",Katenngan da na no pacivahayan na no mavakes ang o kabo rana no peynizpyan da am rakpen da si Pawlo a kani Sila a lololwen a yangay do panipanirsirngen do ili da. 
1237492,"and brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, ","Maniring sira am, ""Sira rana tao do Yotay am da peyzavozavozen o icicirawat do ili ta ya. "
1237493,"and teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans. ","Ta sira mangononong so ta ikarahet a tao do Loma."" "
1237494,"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them. ",So ikamimin da no aro a tao a macioya jira. O panipanirsirngen da am nipakaro da o talili da Pawlo a kani Sila a kapanci da no tao a somipsipzot jira. 
1237495,"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: ",Mateyka da sira sipsipzotan am pasdepen da sira do pamemtengan a kapanci da no mamzamzat a ominlid so ivaod na sira. 
1237496,"who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.",Am ori o nipaneban na rana jira do zosok na rana no pamemtengan a kapasopit na so ai da do kayo a kaji da makapeygonagonayan.
1237497,"And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. ",Avak no ahep am meynozi si Pawlo a kani Sila kapeyyanwanood da somaray ni Ama ta do to. O kararay da nipteng da am to da ngamiznga sira. 
1237498,"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. ",Meyratateng am to ngyan so rako a kanini. Am ori o nikagonagonay no pamemtengan a kapeycyeyweywang na no pangengneban. O nivaod da sira vahalang do lima da am to meycyazavazavat. 
1237499,"And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. ",Mayokay o mamzat jira am to na cita o pangengneban a nimeywang. Ipanci na o kanisomaway da rana no nipteng da tao. Am ori o nipangap na so ipangan na ipanma na do kataotao na. 
1237500,"But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. ","Macita na ni Pawlo am tawagan na. Maniring am, ""Ji mo manomai o kataotao mo. Cyaha, ta namen mamimin a yapa myan do jya."""
1237501,"Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, ",O mamzamzat rana am manovoy so tao a mangap so zampo. Somdep rana am manyahey a to na nizikzik a mangay meylilitod do tangain da da Pawlo a kani Sila. 
1237502,"and brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? ","Meyratateng am powboten na sira. Maniring jira am, ""Manga kahakay, makongo ko so wanjin a kapakahap ko so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ko."" "
1237503,"And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. ","Maniring sira jya am, ""Anoyngan mo si Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. Ta ori o ipakahap nyo so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad nyo a asa ka vahay."" "
1237504,"And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. ",Meyratateng am nanawen da sira asa ka vahay no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237505,"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. ","No kanang na am nioyasan na no mamzamzat o nipeyzazan da Pawlo a kani Sila. Meyratateng am mamimin sira asa ka vahay a nitaktakan da, "
1237506,"And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.","a kapanci da ni Pawlo a kani Sila a macyakan jira do vahay da. So ikasaray da asa ka vahay, do kaniomanoyong da rana ji Ama ta do to."
1237507,"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go. ",Ikadwa na araw do pezak am manovoy o panipanirsirngen da so meykalsong a manci no kapasaway da si Pawlo a kani Sila. 
1237508,"And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace. ","Maniring o mamzamzat ji Pawlo am, ""Na ipanci no panipanirsirngen o na kapasaway jimo a kani Sila. So to nyo na makowboci a somaliway."""
1237509,"But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out. ","Am maniring si Pawlo do meykalsong am, ""Yamen am tao namen do Loma. Am ikongo da todey nipsipzoci jyamen, a da katodey angneban jyamen do pamemtengan a yabo so karatan. Ikongo da taywan sya do taotao so da kapasaway jyamen. So ikarahet no akman sang. Am ori o pancyan nyo no panipanirsirngen, ta mai sira a mapowbot jyamen."" "
1237510,"And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. ",Meyratateng am mangay na ipanci no meykalsong do panipanirsirngen da. Mamizing da si Pawlo a kani Sila a tao do Loma am mamogaw sira. 
1237511,"And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.",Am ori o nyangay da do pamemtengan a meyminaminasi nira kapowbot da rana sira komaro do ili da. 
1237512,"And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.",Makowbot rana si Pawlo a kani Sila do pamemtengan am mangay sira do vahay ni Ditiya. So nipakacita da dang so akma dey kakteh do cinai kapait da sira so nakenakem da ji Yeso a kangay da rana.
1237513,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: ",Meyhatay si Pawlo a kani Sila do peycyeylilyan na do Anveypodi a kado Apoloniya am makaranes rana sira do Tesalonicya. Amyan dang so peyneynozyan da no tao do Yotay. 
1237514,"and Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, ","So to na mangozai ni Pawlo do mina iwawalam na no kakwa pa mangay do peyneynozyan. Ipitlo do ipeywalam no tao a macinekanekad do tao a mangnanao no nivatvatkan a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to, "
1237515,"opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. ","a kaononong na ji Kizisto a nipakakasi da a wakwaken a kavyay na rana sya ni Ama ta do to. Maniring pa am, ""Si Yeso rana ko ipeylimwang jinyo am manoyong a Misayya a nitovoy ni Ama ta do to do teyrahem."" "
1237516,"And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.",Mamizing da no tatasa ka tao do Yotay am to da na anoyngi kapacihza da ji Pawlo a kani Sila. So nikaro no omraralay ni Ama ta do to a tao do Sila kano meynakem a mavakes do dang a omanoyong rana ji Yeso.
1237517,"But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. ",Am o meyili dang a tao do Yotay a ji nganoyong ji Yeso am ikeynanahet da sira. Am ori o nilovotan da so abwata so vazavazay a tao a kano marahet so nakenakem a kapeyzavozavoz da sira so aro a tao a kasdep da do vahay ni Yeson a komala si Pawlo a kani Sila. Ta naknakmen da o kangay da nira do tangain no aro a tao. 
1237518,"And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; ","Am ji da kala sira. Am to da rana rakpa si Yeson a kano karwan da sinjya a lolwen a yangay do panipanirsirngen da. Maniring sira am, ""O tao rana yamapeyzavozavoz so tao do peycyamahamahatawan na am sira rana nimakaranes do jya. "
1237519,"whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of C&#230; sar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. ","Si Yeson am nipeysan na sira do vahay na. So nikamimin da ji nimahap so ciring na ni Kaysa. Ta maniring sira am yamyan so yasa ka panirsirngen a meyngaran si Yeso."" "
1237520,"And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. ",Mamizing da no tao a kano panipanirsirngen am ikarahet da. 
1237521,"And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.",Meyratateng am patorwan da no panipanirsirngen si Yeson a kano kararay na so nizpi. Ori o nipasawayan da rana sira.
1237522,And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. ,Mahep rana am yangay da si Pawlo a kani Sila no akma dey kakteh do cinai do Peyloya. Makaranes rana sira do dang am somdep sira do peyneynozyan no tao do Yotay. 
1237523,"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. ",O tao rana dang am apyapya sira kano sinjya do Tesalonicya. Ta makdeng sira omamizing so ipangnanao da Pawlo. Masangib sira do araraw a tomita so Seysyo. Kakzeben da katenngan o kanoyong na kalas na no ipanci na ni Pawlo. 
1237524,"Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. ",Am ori o nikaro no nimanganoyong a tao do Yotay a kano meynakem a mavakes do Sila kano tao do Sila mahakay.
1237525,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people. ",Am mamizing da no tao do Yotay a meyili do Tesalonicya si Pawlo a meylimwang no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to do Peyloya am mangay sira o tao do Yotay a mapeyvonag so aro a mangamizing a tao. 
1237526,And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.,Am ori o nyangayan da ni Pawlo no sinjya do minato. Si Sila kani Timotay am nimavezed sira do Peyloya. 
1237527,"And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed. ","Makaranes sira do Yatyan o nimacihza ji Pawlo am meysinaoli rana sira do Peyloya a manci no nipakoyokoy na jira ni Pawlo, ta kakzeben na si Sila kani Timotay a makeykai a mangay jya."
1237528,"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. ",Nanalahen na ni Pawlo si Sila kani Timotay do Yatyan am macita na o ili da kakakadayan no ji meyngongyod a tao do to da. So nikaratan na nya no onowned. 
1237529,"Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. ",Am ori o nipacinekanekad na do tao do Yotay a kano omraralay ni Ama ta do to a beken a tao do Yotay do peyneynozyan. So nikasangib na do araraw a macinekanekad do masazi na tao do rarahan. 
1237530,"Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. ","Amyan dang so mangnanao no nanao ni Ipikolo a kani Sitoke. Sira rana am nimai sira macinekanekad ji Pawlo. Maniring o kadwan jira am, ""Ikongo na ipanci no nya a yajyapsepsek ang."" Amyan so manci no, ""Yana ipanci o da iraralay no tarek a pongso."" Ta o ipeylimwang na ni Pawlo am si Yeso a kano keypirwa na nimavyay. "
1237531,"And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? ","Am ori o nihapan da si Pawlo no aro a panipanirsirngen da do peykeykaygyan da a ngaranan da so Adipako. Maniring sira jya am, ""Namen kakzeben o namen kapakateneng do yavayo a mo ipangnanao. "
1237532,For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. ,"Ta namen jyatenngi pa o akman sang a nanao. So pancyan mo nya jyamen so agagazan na."" "
1237533,"(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)",O pancyan da no akman sang am o tao do Yatyan a kano apo do tarek a ili a misan dang a tao am ji da mapakdengi o kapeyvazay da. Ta o ikakza da am kapakamizing da so yeyyak da no cicilwan a ciring.
1237534,"Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. ","So nipeytatanek ni Pawlo do Adipako a peykeykaygyan da. Maniring jira am, ""Inyo rana tao do Yatyan am ko katenngan inyo a yatey makdeng a yamanaralay no tao do to nyo. "
1237535,"For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. ","Ko na nilivon o ili nyo a yatomita so nyo iraralay. So ko nipakacita so nyo nipariparing a papazosan nyo. O yadomket a vatvatek am, 'Jyasingkaji a tao do to.' Sicyaikwa rana ya am ko ipanci jinyo o nyo pa jyatenngi so ngaran a meyngongyod a Tao do to. "
1237536,"God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; ",Iya rana am nimangamamaog so hanit a kano teyrahem a kano meycyamadadayan. So ikanoyong na Panirsirngen do sinokob no hanit. Iya rana am yaji meyvahay do niparing no tao a panaralayan. 
1237537,"neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; ",Iya rana am na ji ngakzeba o tao a somidong sya. Iya o na kapwan no ikavyay no kataotao ta kano meycyamadadayan a kalahen ta tao. 
1237538,"and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; ","Iya o nimangamamaog so asa ka tao a cinapodpodan da no yamavonong do peycyamahamahatawan na tao do teyrahem, a na kapamnek do awawan da no iyan da do karawan a kano yanan da pongso. "
1237539,"that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: ",O na ikakman sang am na kakzeben ni Ama ta do to o kapakateneng da jya no tao. So ta jyahawangi ji Ama ta do to. 
1237540,"for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. ","Ta maniring o asa ka tao am, 'Iya o yapwan no inawan ta do karawan a yaomzat jyaten.' Maniring pa sira o mateneng a tao a macikeylyan jinyo am, 'Yaten rana am akma ney anak yaten.'"
1237541,"Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. ","""No manoyong ta akma ney anak am ji ta naknakma o kapehngay ta si Ama ta do to do nipariparing no tao no apya so kolit a kano kayo a kano veysen a pehngehngain da ji Ama ta do to. "
1237542,And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: ,No kaji da pa makatenngan ji Ama ta do to no tao am ji na naknakma o raraten da. Am sicyaikwaya am na ikakza o tao a yamamlis a komaro rana do peyraratenan da. 
1237543,"because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.","Ta na nipamnekan o araraw na ni Ama ta do to a tomovoy so nipamnekan na a mapacici so tao do teyrahem. Ta iya rana am ji mapeycyakaban so tao. So na jyalasi no kanimawakwak na a kapirwa na sya avyain ni Ama ta do to."""
1237544,"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter. ","Mamizing da si Pawlo a manci no keyyan no nimawakwak a tao a nimirwa mavyay am ipeykeykaming da. Maniring o tatasa jira am, ""Namen tey kakza pa yamizngen o mo ipangnanao."" "
1237545,So Paul departed from among them. ,Meyratateng am karwan na rana ni Pawlo o peykeykaygyan da. 
1237546,"Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.",So niyan no tao a omanoyong ji Yeso a kapacihza da rana ji Pawlo. O asa am asa ka panirsirngen da do Adipako a meyngaran si Tinisyo a kano asa ka mavakes a meyngaran si Tamadi a kano karwan da tao.
1237547,"After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; ",Karwan na ni Pawlo do Yatyan am mangay rana do Kedinto. 
1237548,"and found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. ","Makaranes do dang am makasazi so asa ka tao do Yotay a nimatazak a tao do Pento a meyngaran si Akwila. O kadwan na do vahay am meyngaran si Paycila. Kapo da pa do Itadi, ta o panirsirngen a meyngaran si Kelawti am ipanci na o tao do Yotay a komaro do Loma. So nyangay na ni Pawlo a tomita sira. "
1237549,"And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. ","So nipacivahay na jira macipeyvazay jira, ta meyyangay o vazay da mapakapkapya so vilad a vahay. "
1237550,"And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.","Mangday so ipeywalam no tao yangay ni Pawlo do peyneynozyan a macinekanekad, kananao na so tao do Yotay a kano tao do Sila. Ta kakdain na sira omanoyong ji Yeso."
1237551,"And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. ",Mai rana sira Sila kani Timotay a nimapo do Maciton am masangib si Pawlo a meylimwang nya do tao do Yotay so kanoyong na ni Yeso a Misayya a nitovoy na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237552,"And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. ","Am ji da ngamiznga, ta o karaherahet da sya. Am ori o nitoktokan na ni Pawlo do talili na so ibeybek. Maniring pa jira am, ""Si amyan so oyaoyyan na ninyo ni Ama ta do to no makwa am beken a yaken o raraten an, ta monganay jinyo an. To ko na papwa sicyaraw eya o kangay ko na a mangnanao so beken a tao do Yotay."""
1237553,"And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. ",Meyratateng am karwan na rana sira ni Pawlo a kangay na meyvahay do vahay ni Tito Yoseto. Iya rana am beken a tao do Yotay a omraralay ni Ama ta do to. O vahay na am macitangked do peyneynozyan. 
1237554,"And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. ",O tomalamozong no peyneynozyan a meyngaran si Kedisepo a ka nira asa ka vahay am nimamimin sira omanoyong ji Yeso a kano aro a tao do Kedinto a nimakamizing so nipangnanao ni Pawlo a omanoyong rana ji Yeso a kataktak da jira.
1237555,"Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:","Ipisa kahep na am meygegcin ji Pawlo o ciring ni Yeso akma ney tateynep. Maniring am, ""Ji ka mogaw. Ji mo amtadan o kapangnanao mo, "
1237556,"for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.","ta amyan ko a macikaop jimo. So ikabo no makagogad nimo. Ta do ili rana ya am sira aro o tao meypaza pa omanoyong jyaken."" "
1237557,"And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.",So niyan na dang so kasisi so ikadwa kawan ni Pawlo a mangnanao no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to.
1237558,"And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, ",No kapeypanirsirngen da si Cyadien do Akayya a pongso am meylovolovot sira o tao do Yotay amwoya ni Pawlo. Karahan am lolwen da a yangay do pacicicyan. 
1237559,"saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. ","Maniring sira am, ""Iya rana am na ipanci do tao o kaji ngapan so iwawalam ta a tao do Yotay. Yamacitarek o na ipangnanao so tao a yana ipanop so tao ji Ama ta do to."""
1237560,"And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: ","Naknakmen na ni Pawlo o kapeyzezyak na am to na amizing si Cyadien a mapacici so aro a tao do Yotay. Maniring am, ""No si marahet o akman so sang a vazay am to ko ngamiznga inyo. "
1237561,"but if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. ","Am o nyo ikazyak am yaomagaz do adan a iwawalam nyo. So to nyo rana mapeyvazai sya, ta ko jyakzan eya peyvazain."" "
1237562,And he drave them from the judgment seat. ,"So nipowbotan na sira do pacicicyan, "
1237563,"Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. ",karakep da si Sotenay a tomalamozong no peyneynozyan a kabakbak da jya do pantaw no pacicicyan. Am ji na nikazyak ni Cyadien o akman sang a vazay.
1237564,"And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.","Nimownay pa si Pawlo do Kedinto. Meyratateng am karwan na rana sira o akma ney kakteh do cinai a karara na si Paycila kani Akwila a omavang do avang a mangay do Sidiya. Makaranes sira do Kengkedi am mey na tedtedan o avok na, akma ney yongkad do kanimanci na rana no makdeng a mina ciring na ji Ama ta do to. "
1237565,"And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. ",Makaranes rana sira do Ivoso am taitaiden na rana sira Paycila kani Akwila kangay na rana do peyneynozyan a macinekanekad do tao do Yotay. 
1237566,"When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; ",Taidan da si Pawlo a mownay pa dang amyan am ji na mya ni Pawlo. 
1237567,"but bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. ","Karwan na sira am amyan so ciring na jira. Maniring jira am, ""No si apyahen ni Ama ta do to am pirwan ko pa o kai ko do jya."" Meyratateng am somakay rana do avang a komaro do Ivoso."
1237568,"And when he had landed at C&#230; sarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.",Makaranes si Pawlo do Kaysadiya am mangay do Yelosaleng a tomita so akma ney kakteh do cinai a kangay na rana do Antia. 
1237569,"And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.",So nikownay na dang a kangay na rana do peycyeylilyan na do Cyalatay a kado Vodicya a mapait so onowned da no yamraralay ni Yeso a tao.
1237570,"And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. ",Amyan so asa ka tao do Yotay a meyngaran si Apolo a meyili do Yadisanta nimangay do Ivoso. Iya rana am tey mateneng a mangnanao a mateneng do Seysyo. 
1237571,"This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. ",Amyan so nimnanao sya no ciring a omagaz ji Yeso. Am ori o ikowyat na mangnanao. Am o nipangnanao ni Yowani a nimanaktak o katenngan na. 
1237572,"And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. ",Ori o ji na rana mogawi a mangnanao do peyneynozyan. Mamizing ni Paycila kani Akwila am rarahen da mangay do vahay da kapanci da no ji na pa nimamizing a nanao a omagaz ji Yeso. Ori o nikapiya na rana no ipangnanao na. 
1237573,"And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: ",Meyratateng am naknakmen na ni Apolo o kangay na do Akayya. Ori o nisidongan da sya no akma ney kakteh do cinai do Ivoso a meyteygami nira no omanoyong ji Yeso do Akayya tomaotao sya no mangay jira. Makaranes rana dang si Apolo am arako o nisidongan na sira so nimakahap rana so pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a tao. 
1237574,"for he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.","Ta mowyat a mapasapa do macinekanekad jya tao do Yotay a manci no Seysyo, do kanoyong ni Yeso a Misayya a nitovoy ni Ama ta do to."
1237575,"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, ",Amyan rana si Apolo do Kedinto am meypangay pa si Pawlo do Ivoso. So nipeyliktaw na do Vodicya. Ori o nipakasazi na dang so amraralay ni Yeso Kizisto a tao. 
1237576,"he said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. ","Maniring si Pawlo jira am, ""Manngwa, nimeydedna jinyo o Seyzi no kanoyong nyo ji Yeso Kizisto an?"" Maniring sira am, ""Namen pa jya nimamizing o Seyzi."" "
1237577,"And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. ","Maniring si Pawlo am, ""No ori am sino nyo pangozayan a tomaktak jinyo."" Maniring sira am, ""O nipangnanao ni Yowani a nimanaktak o namen katenngan."" "
1237578,"Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. ","Maniring si Pawlo am, ""O nipanaktak na ni Yowani am yongkad da do mina kapamlis da rana so onowned. O nipanci na pa do Isedi a tao ni Yowani am, 'Anoyngan nyo o yamanownowjyan pa ka nyaken a yamai a meyngaran si Yeso.'"" "
1237579,"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.","Mamizing da o ciring na ni Pawlo am pangozayan da o ngaran ni Yeso to rana mya so kataktak da jira, "
1237580,"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. ",kakadain na sira paoptan na so lima na ni Pawlo. Karahan am meydedna jira o Seyzi. So nipeyzezyak da so matarek a ciriciring no Seyzi a kapeylimwang da no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237581,And all the men were about twelve. ,Sira rana am rarwa sira so ikakarwan o tao.
1237582,"And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.",So nipakatlo na vehan dang ni Pawlo a to ngyan do peyneynozyan a macinekanekad jira a manci no agagazan no italamozong na ni Ama ta do to a mapanod so tao a omanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto. 
1237583,"But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. ",Am tatasa jira o ji mapownot so nakem da amraherahet so nipangnanao ni Pawlo a omagaz ji Yeso Kizisto. Am ori o nipalolwan na so sinjya ni Pawlo a komaro jira. So nipangday da so araw a meysirisiring do pangananawan na vahay no meyngaran so Tilano a tao. 
1237584,"And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.",O akman rana sang a vazay am mina kadwa kawan. Tana tao do Yotay a tana tao do Sila am nimamimin sira o meyvahay do Yasiya a nimakamizing so ciring ni Yeso Kizisto.
1237585,And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: ,Nioyatan na ni Ama ta do to si Pawlo a meyvazay so aro a mapeyzokab a vazay. 
1237586,"so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.",Am ori o nyahapan da no tao so nipeyveynget ni Pawlo a pangain do kataotao da no meyngen a tao a kapya da rana a kavozwaw da no kalamsoyan ni Satan a komovot do tao. 
1237587,"Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. ","So niyan da no tao do Yotay a omlivolivon a amvozwaw so kalamsoyan ni Satan. Sira rana am tana ji da anoyngi si Yeso am ikakza da pangozayan o ngaran ni Yeso. Ori nisirsirngan da so kalamsoyan ni Satan. Maniring sira am, ""Namen pangozayan o ngaran no ipeylimwang ni Pawlo a si Yeso a amvozwaw jinyo."" "
1237588,"And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. ",O nimapeyvazay so sang am papito a ka anak na no asa ka panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a meyngaran so Sekaywa. 
1237589,"And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? ","Tovisan na no kalamsoyan ni Satan sira am, ""Namen kasingkadan si Yeso. Namen katenngan si Pawlo am sino kamo ang."""
1237590,"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. ","O nikovotan rana no kalamsoyan ni Satan a mahakay am mina to zagzag a nimbakbak jira, kapeyzaza da a kapisipising no talili da. Ori nipeypalalayo da a makowbot do vahay ang. "
1237591,"And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. ",Mamizing da no meyvahay do Ivoso a tao do Yotay a kano tao do Sila o akman sang a vazay am manyahey sira. Niminda dang o kapeypakdeng da rana omraralay ni Yeso. 
1237592,"And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. ",So nikaro no amraralay ni Yeso a tao a mai a mapatwaw so nikaratan da no kakwa do tangain no aro a tao. 
1237593,"Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. ","Aro o makahaw a tao a mai no vakong da kasleb da sya. Vilangan da am to ngyan so ikalima na laksa (50, 000) no nizpi a ngina na. "
1237594,So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.,So nipeylimwang na rana do dang no ciriciring na ni Yeso. Ori nipeyparo da no omanoyong jya tao.
1237595,"After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. ","Komavos o aro a vazay am ipanci na ni Pawlo o kapangonong na do Maciton a kado Akayya a mangay do Yelosaleng. Maniring am, ""Si makaranes ko do dang am mangay ko pa do Loma."" "
1237596,"So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.",So nipanman na so rarwa ka somidong sya si Timotay a kani Ilato a mangay do Maciton. Si Pawlo am mina todavezed do Yasiya.
1237597,And the same time there arose no small stir about that way. ,No kanang do Ivoso am amyan so nimakdeng a vazay a ikazyak da. Ori rana am omagaz do kownot da ji Yeso Kizisto. 
1237598,"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen; ","Amyan so asa ka meyngaran si Temolyo a mapakapkapya so gizit a ipamaring na so likta panaralayan da raralayan da no meyngaran so Atemey. Ikongo do aro tao a macipeyvazay jya, am ori o ikaro no nizpi a mahap da. "
1237599,"whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. ","Si Temolyo rana am lovoten na o aro a lamlamsoy na kano tao a akman sya so vazay. Maniring jira am, ""Manga keypong, nyo katenngan o na karo no nizpi a ta mahap. "
1237600,"Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: ","Ko ipanci jinyo am nyo na nimamizing, nyo na nimacita o icicirawat na kano vazay na ni Pawlo. Ta maniring asyo am, 'O nipariparing rana no tao a iraralay da am beken a meyngongyod a Tao do to.' O akman sang a ciring am da to nganoyngi no aro a tao do Ivoso a kado Yasiya. "
1237601,"so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. ","Ko citahen rana o vazay ta am yamyan so ikarahet na. Ta o iraralay ta Atemey am yato meypapereh rana sira o tao a yaomraralay nya. Ta do Yasiya rana kado peycyamahamahatawan na am yato meypabo rana o na kadmayan no yata iraralay."""
1237602,"And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.","Mamizing da no aro a tao o akman sang a ciring am meyoyaoya rana sira. Maniring rana sira am, ""O iraralay ta do Ivoso a Atemey am tey maizay."" "
1237603,"And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre. ",Ori o nipeyvonag da asa ka ili a karakep da so kararay ni Pawlo a rarwa meyili do Maciton a meyngaran si Cyayo a kani Aditako a kalololo da sira yangay do rako a peylovolovotan da. 
1237604,"And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. ",Kakdain na ni Pawlo o kangay na jira am ji da mya no sinjya. 
1237605,"And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre. ","O tatasa panipanirsirngen da no Yasiya a kagagan na ni Pawlo am manovoy sira so tao a omzazat ji Pawlo a jyangay do peylovolovotan da, ta ikanginanawa da. "
1237606,"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together. ",No kanang am amlololos sira o aro a tao a meyzavozavoz so ciriciring. So ikaro no ji makateneng jya tao do agagazan no kalovot da do dang. 
1237607,"And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people. ","O tao do Yotay am padondonen da si Yadisanta a mangay do tangain da. Maniring sira aro a tao am, ""Iya ya o yamapeyvazay sya."" Am ori o nipatalan na so lima na ni Yadisanta a manci no ciring na do aro a tao. "
1237608,"But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.","Am katovilan da si Yadisanta a tao do Yotay. Am ori o nilololos da. Maniring sira am, ""Ney maizay na o Atemey a iraralay ta do Ivoso!"" So nikadwa na ka toki no nilololos da."
1237609,"And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? ","Mownay am o meyvatvatek a panirsirngen do ili da am ori o nimapeyreherehes sira. Maniring jira am, ""Inyo rana Ivoso a tao am sino ji makateneng jya, do ka yaten no yamzat do panaralayan no maizay a ta iraralay a Atemey a kano vato a kataotao na nimeyhekas apo do hanit. "
1237610,"Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. ",Si pacyanoyngan nyo o akman sang a vazay am meyreherehes kamo na an. Taosya o kapatarek nyo so marahet a vazay nyo. Ahapen nyo o apiya pangtoktwan nyo. 
1237611,"For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. ",Ta o nyo nyai yararwa ka tao do jya am yabwata o nitakaw da do panaralayan. Yabo da niraherahet so tao do to ta. 
1237612,"Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another. ",Si myan so ikazyak da da Temolyo a kano macivazay jya a tao am pamnekan da o araraw no ipeysirsiring da do pacicicyan. Ta ori o amizngan da so ciring da no panirsirngen. 
1237613,"But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. ","Si myan pa so ikarahet nyo am nanalahen nyo o araraw no ipeykeykaygi, kakavos na rana. "
1237614,"For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse. ","O ta nipeyvonag rana sicyaraw eya am jyabo kaji da oyyan nyaten no panirsirngen do Loma, do na kabo no peypeypangayan na."" "
1237615,"And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.",Teyka na o ciring na am peysyasyain na sira o aro a tao.
1237616,"And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. ","Meyrehes rana o nipeyvonag da am lovoten na sira ni Pawlo o amraralay ni Yeso, kapait na sira kataitaid na rana sira. So nikarwan na rana dang a mangay do Maciton. "
1237617,"And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, ","So nilivonan na so ili da pangonongan a mapait so sinjya, kangay na rana do Akayya. "
1237618,"and there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. ",So nisan na dang so katlo a vehan. Vovwan na o kavang na do avang a mangay do Sidiya am to na sapa o tao do Yotay a omvovo jya zakaten. Am ori o nipancyan na no kato na rana meysinaoli a meyliktaw do Maciton. 
1237619,"And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. ","O nimacihza jya am tao do Peyloya, anak na ni Pilo a meyngaran so Sopate a kano tao do Tesalonicya a meyngaran so Aditako a kani Sikongto a kano tao do Tepey a meyngaran so Cyayo a kano tao do Yasiya a meyngaran so Timotay a kani Ticiko a kani Teloveymo. "
1237620,These going before tarried for us at Troas.,So nikehzehza da manma mangay do Teloya ili a amnanala jyamen. 
1237621,"And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days. ",Mahatas rana o nipamaring da so kanen do yakan da so ji nimimway a pang am nimapo namen do Veydipi. Kalima araw namen a niomavang do avang am makaranes namen do Teloya. So nipakacita namen rana so kararay namen a nimanmanma a nimangay. Karahan am misan namen do dang so kapito araw.
1237622,"And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. ","Makoyab do niciyo am malovot namen a kano akma nameney kakteh do cinai a mahahanghang a makanakem si Yeso a nimawakwak no raraten ta. So todavaki jya do ahep ni Pawlo a mangnanao, ta imong na o kangay na rana do ikadwa na araw. "
1237623,"And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.",Aro zampo do ikatlo na vava no vahay a peylovolovotan namen. 
1237624,"And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. ","Amyan so asa ka malavayo a tao a meyngaran si Yotike a amlisna do ngoso no pazevngen. Ikongo do tey naro o ipangnanao ni Pawlo, am ori o nikakaha na ni Yotike. Karahan am todey manazasaz a makas do teyrahem. Citahen da am abo rana o inawan na. "
1237625,"And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. ","So nyangay na ni Pawlo a kasapopo na sya. Maniring am, ""Ji nyo alawan an, ta yana mavyay an."" "
1237626,"When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. ",Tomanggeh rana si Pawlo do kavava no vahay am ahapen na o myanpaw a kakan na sya a kapangnanao na rana. So nyangay na do madagdag no ipangnanao na a kakaro na rana jira. 
1237627,"And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.",So nikavyay na rana no malavayo a tao ang. So nikasaray da no tao a mangay nya do vahay da.
1237628,"And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot. ",Nimanmanma namen a omavang do avang a mangay do Aso. Si Pawlo am to mangonong do rarahan. Ipanci na o kangay namen masinsinmo do Aso a ili. 
1237629,"And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene. ","Makaranes namen do Aso am masinmo namen si Pawlo. Am ori o nipavangan namen sya do avang, kangay namen rana do Mitidini. "
1237630,"And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus. ",Ikadwa na araw am makaranes namen do Cio. Ikatlo na araw am nimangay namen someyked do Samo. Ikapat na araw am makaranes namen rana do Midito. 
1237631,"For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.","Nakenakem na ni Pawlo o kaji namen neykedan do Ivoso, ta ihawa na kasengseng namen do Yasiya, ta meybezbez si Pawlo a mangay do Yelosaleng. Ta ikakza na o kapakapis na so pamaringan da so kanen no tao do Yotay do Osinci."
1237632,"And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. ",Amyan si Pawlo do Midito am manovoy so tao a mangay do Ivoso a manci no panipanirsirngen do kyokay a mai a tomita sya. 
1237633,"And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, ","Mai rana sira am pacisirsirngan na rana sira ni Pawlo. Maniring jira am, ""Nyo katenngan o icicirawat ko no ka ori pa so kangay ko do Yasiya. "
1237634,"serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: ","Ko ji pahamaha o nakenakem ko do ko kahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to. Tana peyrarehten da yaken no tao do Yotay, tana kalahen da yaken a zakaten am ji ko a mamman. O kapeyvazay ko so vazay ni Ama ta do to. "
1237635,"and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, ","Nyo katenngan manga keypong, no ko myan do peylovolovotan no tao a kado peycyakavakavahayan am ko nanawen inyo. Ko miminen o apya ciring a yako ivavaga jinyo. So ikabo no ko taywen jinyo. "
1237636,"testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. ","Tana tao do Yotay a tana tao do Sila am yako inyo to peyyangangaya a yananawen, do ko kakza ninyo a mamlis so nakem a omanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. "
1237637,"And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: ","So ko na karwan jinyo sicyaikwaya a mangay do Yelosaleng, ta onotan ko o ipanci na jyaken no Seyzi. Am ji ko a tenngi o masapa ko dang a vazay. "
1237638,"save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. ","O ko katenngan am o na nipaziman jyaken no Seyzi do kapteng da jyaken, do karo no alalaw ko. "
1237639,"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. ",Am ko jyalawan o inawan ko. Ta ko kakakzeb so kakavos na no vazay ko a na nitoro jyaken ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. So peylimwangan ko no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a omagaz do pangangarilawan na.
1237640,"And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. ","""No keyyan ko pa jinyo am nipanci ko na jinyo o omagaz do italamozong na ni Ama ta do to. Am ko na to mancyan jinyo am ji nyo na cita yaken. "
1237641,"Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. ",To ko na macitangain jinyo manga keypong am no si myan jinyo so ji nganoyong ji Yeso Kizisto am nakenakem na rana. 
1237642,For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.,Ta yabo rana o ko taywen a nanao ni Ama ta do to. 
1237643,"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. ",So ipeypepzat nyo an. Ahapen nyo o nitoro na jinyo no Seyzi a marilaw no kadwan jinyo. Ta sira rana am nipalit na no rala no Anak na ni Ama ta do to a yarana macikaop jya. 
1237644,"For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. ",Ta ko katenngan si karwan ko rana inyo am amyan so mangalalas a tao a mai a omnanao jinyo a mapeycyakawad jinyo a amraralay ni Yeso a tao. 
1237645,"Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. ",Ta no makwa am amyan do tangain nyo so mangononong so malas amlita do amraralay ni Yeso Kizisto a tao. No amyan so akman sang a tao am ji nyo ngonoci. 
1237646,"Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.",Ori o apzatan nyo do onowned nyo an. Manakem nyo o ninanao ko jinyo a nimeykaoo ninyo an. Ta mina katlo a kawan ko a mangday so araraw a kano ahep a amnanao jinyo.
1237647,"And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. ","""Sicyaikwaya am ko na to norwan inyo ji Ama ta do to. Ta ko ipeyhanhan o pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a somidong jinyo a to ngotokot so nakem a meyhanhan nya. No si makman kamo sang am mahap nyo na o igeygeglaw na so omraralay nya tao. "
1237648,"I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. ",Yaken rana am yabo pa o yako nikamkam a nizpi a kano ayob da no tao. 
1237649,"Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. ",Ta nyo katenngan yaken a yamowyat a meyvazay a omyaw no velek ko a yaomlam so kararay ko. 
1237650,"I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.","Am ori o inaran nyo jyaken an. So ipakowyat nyo a meyvazay an. Ta ori o ipakasidong nyo so ji makahakaw a tao. Manakem nyo o mina ciring na jyaten ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. Ta maniring si Yeso am, 'Rakorako pa o sarasaray no onowned no mangazaw a kano azawen da tao.'"""
1237651,"And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. ",Teyka na ori a ciring ni Pawlo am mamimin sira meylilitod a meynozi. 
1237652,"And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, ","So nikamimin da meycyalavilavi a komopkop si Pawlo adkanan a taitaiden, "
1237653,"sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.",do kapakanakem da so ciring ni Pawlo a manci no kaji da rana makacittan sya. So nikeyngen no onowned da. So nikamimin da macihza ji Pawlo a mapasakay sya do avang.
1237654,"And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: ",Mateyka namen sira taitaiden am somakay namen rana do avang a mangay do Kese a pongso. Ikadwa na araw am makaranes namen do Lotaw a ikatlo na araw am mangay namen do Patala. 
1237655,"and finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.",Amyan namen do Patala am masazi namen o asa ka avang a mangay do Vongnise. So nipacisakay namen jira. 
1237656,"Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden. ",O angayan namen am masngen do Saypolose a pongso. Niliklik namen o Saypolose a pongso a mangay do Sidiya a pongso a kapeygegcin namen do Tayar a ili. Ta mapagcigcin sira dang so warawara. 
1237657,"And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. ","Nimakacita namen dang so sinjya. Ori o nisan namen dang so kapito araw. Mangay rana si Pawlo am pakeken da si Pawlo a jyangay do Yelosaleng, ta amyan dang so nipanci na no Seyzi a ikanginanawa na ni Pawlo. "
1237658,"And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed. ","Karwan namen rana sira am macihza sira jyamen o sinjya a kapalolo da so katovong da do vahay a kano anak da mangay a tomaitaid jyamen. So nikalovot namen a meylilitod do pasalan a meynozi ji Ama ta do to, "
1237659,"And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.",a kataitaid namen rana sira kavang namen rana do avang. O sinjya am mangay rana sira do kavahayan da.
1237660,"And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.",So nisongay na rana no avang apo do Tayar a mangay do Todimay. Makaranes namen do dang am mangay namen itazogaw sira o sinjya a kapacisan namen jira so kasahep. 
1237661,"And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto C&#230; sarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him. ",Ikadwa na araw am karwan namen rana dang a mangay do Kaysadiya. So nirateng namen do vahay ni Veydipo. Iya rana am vazay na o kapeylimwang na no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to.

1237662,"And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.",Amyan so papat a mavakes a anak na a jya nimacivahavahay pa. Sira rana am mamimin sira mateneng a mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to.
1237663,"And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Jud&#230; a a certain prophet, named Agabus. ",Asa ka peywalam no tao o nisan namen dang. Amyan so asa ka tao a meyngaran si Acyapo a panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to apo do Yotay. 
1237664,"And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. ","Nimai a tomita jyamen. Mai ori am ahapen na o abtek na ni Pawlo a kato na ngonangan do lima na kano ai na a vaoden. Maniring am, ""Yamaniring o Seyzi am, 'O mapeyyabtek rana so sya am vaoden da no tao do Yotay do Yelosaleng a katoro da nya do beken a tao do Yotay.'"" "
1237665,"And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.",Mamizing namen o akman sang a ciring na am ji namen novoya si Pawlo a mangay do Yelosaleng. 
1237666,"Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. ","Am maniring si Pawlo am, ""Ikongo nyo lavyan jyaken a ko ikarahet no onowned. Cyaha, ta ko ahapen o vazay ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. Tana vaoden da yaken do Yelosaleng a mawakwak do dang am cyaha, ta nakenakem ko an."" "
1237667,"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.","Ji namen a pasovoy si Pawlo am to namen rana a macipanadngi. Maniring namen am, ""Inaoy no si mangononong o ahahapan na sya ni Ama ta do to."""
1237668,"And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem. ",Meyratateng am ahapen namen rana o apzapzatan namen a mangay do Yelosaleng. 
1237669,"There went with us also certain of the disciples of C&#230; sarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.",Amyan so apo do Kaysadiya a sinjya a macilolo jyamen a kangay da nyamen do vahay na ni Nason a tao do Saypolose pongso. Iya rana am nimeycicinda amraralay ni Yeso Kizisto.
1237670,"And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. ",Makaranes namen do Yelosaleng am aro dang o sinjya a magaga a tomaotao jyamen. 
1237671,And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present. ,Ikadwa na araw am macihza namen ji Pawlo a mangay tomita si Yake. O panipanirsirngen rana do kyokay am amyan sira dang. 
1237672,"And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.","So nipeyminaminasyan na nira ni Pawlo a kapanci na no vazay na ni Ama ta do to jya do beken a tao do Yotay, do mina kapeylimwang na no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to jira. "
1237673,"And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: ","Mamizing da no akma nameney kakteh do cinai am isaray da ji Ama ta do to. Am maniring sira ji Pawlo am, ""Mo kakteh, do namen naknakman sya am ala sira rana amlaksa o tao a omanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto a tao do Yotay. Sira rana ori am makdeng sira mahap so iwawalam na ni Moyse. "
1237674,"and they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. ",Mamizing da imo a nimangnanao so tao do Yotay a meyili do beken a ili da no tao do Yotay am nipanci mo kono o kataosya da so iwawalam ni Moyse. Nipanci mo kono o kataosya da rana so kayongkad do kanakan. 
1237675,What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. ,No si mamizing da imo no tao do Yotay a nimai do jya a kai da do jya mapacici jyamen am ikongo ipasapa namen jira. 
1237676,Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; ,Hapen mo o ciring namen jimo an. Amyan so papat a ka tao a nimyan so ciring ji Ama ta do to. 
1237677,"them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. ","Palolwen mo sira a macihza jimo a mangay omahap so iwawalam ta tao do Yotay a katoro mo so nizpi do akdawan da jira. Golgolan da o oo da.

Ta si makman kamo sang am panoyngen da rana imo no tao a jya nimanci no akman sang a vazay, do kapacyanoyong mo do iwawalam no tao do Yotay. "
1237678,"As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.","Yamen rana am nipeyteygami namen sira o yaomanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto a beken a tao do Yotay, do kaji da nganan so nipazos da, kaji da nganan so rala no vinyay kano nivitkeh da vinyay a nimazakat a jya nimvoyog so rala. Taosya o kapangzakza da so icyatatao da."""
1237679,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.",Ikadwa na araw am palolwen na sira o papat a ka tao ang ni Pawlo a mangay mahap so iwawalam da no tao do Yotay.

1237680,"And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, ",Makeykai rana komavos o ikapito na araw am amyan so tao do Yotay apo do Yasiya a nimakacita si Pawlo do rako a panaralayan. Karahan am manara sira so aro a tao a kapeyvonag da sira. Ori o nirakpan da si Pawlo. 
1237681,"crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place. ","Maniring sira am, ""Inyo rana Isedi a tao am sidongen nyo yamen an.

1237682,"(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)",O pancyan da no akman sang am nimacita da si Pawlo a kano asa ka tao do Ivoso a meyngaran si Teloveymo do Yelosaleng. Am ori o nipatolinan da sya ji Pawlo a nimapalolo sya somdep do rako a panaralayan.
1237683,"And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut. ",Meyratateng am meyvonag sira o asa ka ili a karanes da mai no aro a tao amrakep si Pawlo. Karahan am powboten da do rako a panaralayan a kaslet da rana jya. 
1237684,"And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. ",To da ji wakwaka si Pawlo am keyyan no asa ka panirsirngen no itaysang no Loma a nimakamizing sya. 
1237685,"Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. ","Karahan am mapalolo so aro a itaysang a mangay do meyvonag a tao. Macita da no aro a tao o panirsirngen da no itaysang a kano aro a itaysang am iptad da rana o kabakbak da ji Pawlo, "
1237686,"Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.","kangay na omrakep si Pawlo no panirsirngen da no itaysang kavaod da sya no nipeylalin da adwa ka vahalang. Maniring am, ""Sino ka ya. Ikongo vazay mo ang."" "
1237687,"And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle. ","Maniring sira o aro a tao a amlololos am, ""Ori a ori o kakwan na no vazay no nya.""

1237688,"And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. ","Amyan sira do zazakdangan am ikongo do tey masosozi sira o aro a tao, am ori o nikasamosamozongan da ji Pawlo no aro a itaysang a isdep do sahad. "
1237689,"For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.","Am macilolo pa sira o aro a tao a amlololos. Maniring sira am, ""Zakaten ta si Pawlo!"""
1237690,"And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? ","Toda jindep sira do vahay da no itaysang am maniring si Pawlo do panirsirngen da am, ""Apyahen mo keyyan no asa ka ciring ko?"" Tovisan na no panirsirngen am, ""Mo katenngan o ciring no tao do Sila? "
1237691,"Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers? ","Beken a tao ka do Ayci asyo a nimraherahet so seyvo a nimapalolo so kakapatan a ranaw (4000) a mararahet so nakenakem a tao a nitomayo do kabwan no nihakawan no tao?"" "
1237692,"But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people. ","Maniring si Pawlo am, ""Yaken rana am tao do Yotay ko a nimatazak a tao do Tasose a rako a ili do Cidicya. Apyahen mo yaken a macisirsiring do aro a tao?"" "
1237693,"And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, ","So nipyan na sya no panirsirngen no itaysang. Meyratateng am meytatanek si Pawlo do zazakdangan a mapatala so lima na do aro a tao. Am ori o ji da nimeykazyazyaki no aro a tao. Karahan am sirsirngen na sira ni Pawlo no ciring da no Sipolay.

1237694,"Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you. ","""Manga maran, manga kakteh, amizngen nyo o ko ipanci jinyo, manga keypong an."" "
1237695,"(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith, )","Mamizing da si Pawlo a meyzezyak so ciring da no Sipolay am yeyyak da. Meyratateng am mangononong rana si Pawlo. Maniring am, "
1237696,"I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day. ","""Yaken rana am tao do Yotay ko a nimatazak a tao do Tasose a macinapnap do Cidicya am nimamno ko do Yelosaleng eya.

1237697,"And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. ",No kakwa pa am makdeng ko a nimapakakasi so amraralay ni Yeso a tao. So niyan no nimawakwak ko jira ang. Tana mavakes a tana mahakay am abo o ji ko rakpa jira a pain do pamemtengan. 
1237698,"As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished. ","To nyo mancyan do panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan, ta sira ang o nimakacita jyaken a nimanta nyaken so teygami a mangay do Tamaseke a omya jyaken a omrakep so amraralay ni Yeso a tao a yangay do Yelosaleng a bakbakan."
1237699,"And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. ","""Tod ko a ji makaranes do Tamaseke do peyignan no araw am to ngyan so mazngang apo do teyngato a tomiray jyaken. "
1237700,"And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?","Am ori o nikavazakwang ko do teyrahem. Karahan am amyan so ciring. Maniring am, 'Mo Sawlo, mo Sawlo, ikongo yamo pakakasyan jyaken.' "
1237701,"And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.","Maniring ko jya am, 'Mo Panirsirngen, sino ka.' Maniring am, 'Yaken rana am si Yeso ko a tao do Nasale a yamo pakakasin.' "
1237702,"And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. ",O kararay ko am nimacita da o maniray. O zezyak a nimamizing ko am ji da nimamizing. 
1237703,"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.","Pacicin ko am, 'Mo Panirsirngen, meypanngonngo ko so wanjin eya.'

1237704,"And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. ","Ikongo do tey macimat o zezngangen na, am ori o nikakowap ko. Karahan am to da rana ngalaya yaken no kararay ko a yangay do Tamaseke."
1237705,"And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there, ","""Amyan dang so asa ka tao a meyngaran si Ananiya. Iya rana ori am manoyong a mahap so iwawalam ni Moyse. So kanigan da nya no tao do Yotay amyan do Tamaseke. "
1237706,"came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. ","Mai ori jyaken am maniring am, 'Mo Sawlo, akma koy kakteh do cinai, makacita ka rana.' No kanang rana am mina to ko na makacita. "
1237707,"And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth. ","Maniring jyaken am, 'Yana nipamnekan imo no Tao do to da no ineynapo ta a mahap so vazay na, do mo kanimakacita si Yeso a Anak na ni Ama ta do to, do kanimakamizing mo so ciring ni Yeso. "
1237708,For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard. ,Imo rana am ipeylimwang mo do aro a tao o mo nimacita kano mo nimamizing. 
1237709,"And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. ",Am ori o ji mo meypahahai. Peyvangon rana a kapamlis mo na so nakenakem. Tawagan mo o ngaran ni Yeso a omvonas so raraten mo a kataktak da jimo.' Ori o ciring na jyaken ni Ananiya.
1237710,"And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance; and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.","""Kadadayan na so araraw am meyoli ko a mangay do Yelosaleng a mangay meynozi do rako a panaralayan. Meyratateng am akma raney tateynep ko si Yeso a to ko a cita. Maniring jyaken am, 'Makeykai ka komaro do Yelosaleng an.

Ta o tao rana jya am da jyakzan a yamizngen o mo ipeylimwang jira a ciriciring ko.' "
1237711,"And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee: ","Maniring ko am, 'Mo Panirsirngen, da mamimin yaken no tao a yakatenngan a yamapakakasi so aro a yamraralay nimo do peyneynozyan. "
1237712,"and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him. ",No kawakwak da so nimeylimwang no ciriciring mo a meyngaran so Setiven am nimacizanod ko jira a tomita so aywayob da.' 
1237713,"And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.","Maniring jyaken si Yeso am, 'To ka nangay. Ko na to novoya imo a mangay do ili da no beken a tao do Yotay a meylimwang no ciriciring ko.'"""
1237714,"And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live. ","Mamizing da no tao o niononongan ni Pawlo am amlololos sira manci no, ""Zakaten ta si Pawlo. Zakaten ta si Pawlo. Jyabo kavyay so akman sya ya."" "
1237715,"And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air, ",So nilololos da mapatalatala so ayob da kapeymeymozasik da so tana. 
1237716,"the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him. ",O panirsirngen no itaysang no Loma am iyokod na si Pawlo a isdep do vahay da no itaysang a kasipsipzot da jya pacicin. Ta si ori pa o patwawan na ni Pawlo so karatan na. 
1237717,"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? ","To da ji nipsipzoci am maniring si Pawlo do itaysang amyan dang am, ""Manngwa, manoyong a iwawalam nyo a Loma o kapanmanma nyo a mamakbak so tao do Loma an? No manmanma o kakala nyo so karatan na."" "
1237718,"When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman. ","Mamizing na no itaysang o ciring ni Pawlo am to rana angay a komala so panirsirngen da. Maniring jya am, ""Ka nimeypanngonngo eya. Mo jyatenngi ori a tao do Loma?"" "
1237719,"Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. ","Karahan am mangay na citahen no panirsirngen si Pawlo. Maniring am, ""Ka manoyong a tao do Loma ya an?"" Maniring si Pawlo am, ""Noon."" "
1237720,"And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born. ","Maniring ji Pawlo o panirsirngen no itaysang am, ""Yaken rana am yaro o nizpi a yako ningina do kataotao ko. Ori o ko rana ipeyngongyod a tao do Loma."" Maniring si Pawlo am, ""Nimapo no katazak a tao ko o ka Loma ko."" "
1237721,"Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.","Mamizing da no omvovo ji Pawlo a bakbakan am mina to da rana ngaroi. So nikalaw na no panirsirngen da no itaysang, ta katenngan na si Pawlo a tao do Loma a todey vaoda."
1237722,"On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.","Ikongo do kakzeben na no panirsirngen da no itaysang o kapakateneng na do oyyan da ni Pawlo no tao do Yotay, am ori o niovayan na so nivaod da sya do ikadwa na araw a kalovot na so panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano macipeykaygi jira a kamanrarakehan a kapowbot da si Pawlo a patanken do tangain da."
1237723,"And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day. ","Singkadan na sira ni Pawlo o macipeykaygi a tao. Maniring jira am, ""Manga kakteh, o iwawalam ko no kalyalikey ko am abo pasagpyanan ko so nakenakem ko do tangain ni Ama ta do to a yato ngai sicyaraw eya an."" "
1237724,And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. ,Mamizing na no panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a meyngaran so Ananiya am manara so tao a somiplang so ngoso ni Pawlo. 
1237725,"Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? ","Maniring si Pawlo jya am, ""Mangay o kapasingesinget na jimo ni Ama ta do to, do mo kaji raralayan nya. Ta imo rana am mo jya nyahap o iwawalam ta mapacici jyaken. So mo ikalas so iwawalam a yato manci no tao a yasomiplang jyaken."" "
1237726,"And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest? ","Maniring sira o macitangked jya tao am, ""Yaka makongo a yajyasnesnek no panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem ta si Ama ta do to."" "
1237727,"Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.","Maniring si Pawlo am, ""Manga kakteh, no ko nikatenngan ori a panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem si Ama ta do to am ko jya nioya. Ta o ciring do Seysyo am, 'Ji nyo ngavaya o panirsirngen nyo.'"""
1237728,"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question. ","To na rana tenngi ni Pawlo o kapeypinpin da no tao a macyagom do Satokay a kano macyagom do Vadisay. Am ori o nilolos na do peykeykaygyan da. Maniring am, ""Manga kakteh, yaken rana am ko macyagom do Vadisay. O ineynapo ko am macyagom do Vadisay. O nyo pacicyan jyaken sicyaraw eya am ko kanoyong do keypirwa mavyay no nimawakwak a tao an."" "
1237729,"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided. ",Kapakamizing da so ciring ni Pawlo am meygalagalagal sira o tao a macyagom do Vadisay a kano macyagom do Satokay. So nipeykadwa no nakenakem da a ji macipaswasovoy do kadwan jira. 
1237730,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both. ",Ta ji da nganoyngi no tao a macyagom do Satokay o keypirwa da mavyay no nimawakwak a tao. Ji da nganoyngi o keyyan no tinsi a kano keyyan no pahad no tao. Am o tao a macyagom do Vadisay am miminen da ori a anoyngan. 
1237731,"And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.","So nikarakorako pa no ilololosan da. So nipeytatanek da no karwan da no tao a macyagom do Vadisay a mangnanao no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to. Maniring sira am, ""Namen jyakala o na karatan no tao eya. Tana yamyan so tinsi a kano pahad a macisirsiring jya am ta karatan nya."" "
1237732,"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle. ","Ikeykavevek da amlololos. Ikongo do peypazapazangan da rana si Pawlo, am ori o nipanovoy na no panirsirngen no itaysang so itaysang a mangay omvozcin sya jira a isdep do sahad."
1237733,"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.","Mahep rana am mai si Yeso do katangked ni Pawlo. Maniring am, ""Ji ka onib, mo Pawlo an. To mo peynara no kapeylimwangan mo nyaken do Yelosaleng a meylimwang nyaken do Loma."""
1237734,"And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy. ","Ikadwa na araw do penzak am kakapatan (40) sira o tao do Yotay a nimeysirisiring. Maniring sira am, ""Si ji ta zakat si Pawlo am jyabo kapangakaday ta."" Ikadwa na araw do penzak am kakapatan (40) sira o tao do Yotay a nimeysirisiring. Maniring sira am, ""Si ji ta zakat si Pawlo am jyabo kapangakaday ta."" "
1237735,"And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul. ","Meyratateng am mangay sira do panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan. Maniring sira am, ""Namen rana teyka a meysirisiring. No si ji namen a zakat si Pawlo am ji namen mangakaday. "
1237736,"Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.","Inyo rana panipanirsirngen am ipanci nyo o panirsirngen no itaysang no Loma a mai ni Pawlo do jya, akma nyoy pacicin a komala so karatan na. A yamen am avatan namen do jya wakwaken si mai do jya."""
1237737,"And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul. ",Mamizing na o ciring ori no manganak no kakteh ni Pawlo am mangay do vahay no itaysang a mangay manci nya ji Pawlo. 
1237738,"Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him. ","Am ori o nipanara na ni Pawlo so asa ka itaysang. Maniring jya am, ""Palolwen mo o malavayo a tao ito a mangay do panirsirngen nyo, ta yamyan so na ipanci jya."" "
1237739,"So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee. ","Am ori o nipalolwan na sya mangay do panirsirngen da. Maniring am, ""Si Pawlo rana yata nipteng eya am na ipanci yaken a yamapalolo so tao eya mangay a tomita jimo. Ta yamyan so na ipanci jimo."" "
1237740,"Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me? ","So nikalayan na sya no panirsirngen so malavayo a tao ang a pahawahen na a sirsirngen. Maniring am, ""Ikongo mo ipanci jyaken."" "
1237741,"And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly. ","Maniring am, ""Da nipeysirisiring no tao do Yotay o kapya mo si Pawlo simaraw a mangay do rako a peykeykaygyan, akma dey pacicin. "
1237742,"But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee. ","Am ji mo ngonoci sira an, ta yamyan so kakapatan (40) a tao a yaomavat jya wakwaken. Ta o ciring da am, 'No si ji ta wakwaka si Pawlo am ji ta mangakaday.' Imo rana o da ahesen."" "
1237743,"So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.","Maniring jya o panirsirngen da no itaysang am, ""Ji mo mancyan do tao o kanimanci mo nya jyaken so akman sya vazay an."" Meyratateng am tovoin na rana mangay."
1237744,"And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to C&#230; sarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; ","Am ori o nipanara na no panirsirngen no itaysang so rarwa ka lamlamsoy na. Maniring jira am, ""Meykala kamo so adwa poo (200) a itaysang a kano kakapitwan (70) a omavang do baka a itaysang a kapeykala nyo pa so adwa poo (200) a meycinalolot a macihza jira. Ta simahep do ikasyam no toki am yangay nyo si Pawlo do Kaysadiya, "
1237745,"and provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.","a kapeykala nyo ni Pawlo so avangan na baka a kapacihza nyo jya a rarayan a mangay ji Veydise a kabtekan ta panirsirngen."" "
1237746,And he wrote a letter after this manner: ,"Meyratateng am meyteygami jya o panirsirngen ang. Maniring am, "
1237747,Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting. ,"""Yaken rana am si Kelawti Disiya. Ko ipeyteygami imo a panirsirngen namen. Maran kong mo Veydise. "
1237748,"This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman. ",Si Pawlo rana ya am yada nirakep no tao do Yotay. Da naknakmen o da kawakwak sya. Am katenngan ko rana tao do Loma si Pawlo am ori o nipanara ko so itaysang a yamangay nya jimo. 
1237749,"And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council: ",Si Pawlo am nyangay ko do rako a peykeykaygyan. Ta ko naknakmen o ko kakala so agagazan no da oyyan nya. 
1237750,"whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. ","O nioyyan da nya am ipanci da o kaji na ngapan no iwawalam da no tao do Yotay. Am ko jyatenngi o peypeypangayan no da wakwakan sya, da aptengan sya. "
1237751,"And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.","Mamizing ko o keyyan no amvovo jya wakwaken am ori o ko peyteygamyan nimo a omzat jya. O ko nipanci do tao do Yotay am, 'Mangay kamo pa do kabtekan ta panirsirngen a manci no agagazan no yanyo nirakpan si Pawlo.'"""
1237752,"Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris. ",Karahan am yangay da rana si Pawlo no aro a itaysang do Antipate do mahep. 
1237753,"On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: ",Ikadwa na araw am meysinaoli rana sira o katey da no itaysang do vahay da. Omavang do baka a itaysang am ori o macihza ji Pawlo. 
1237754,"who, when they came to C&#230; sarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him. ",Makaranes sira do Kaysadiya am itoro da rana o teygami do kabtekan da panirsirngen a katoro da ni Pawlo jya. 
1237755,"And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia; ",Vilangan na no panirsirngen o teygami am pacicin na o nikapwan na ili ni Pawlo. Ori o nipakatenngan na rana jya tao do Cidicya. 
1237756,"I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.","Maniring am, ""Si makaranes rana sira o tao a yamraherahet jimo am pacicin ko imo."" Meyratateng am ipanci na o itaysang a amzat jya do vahay no mina panirsirngen da a meyngaran so Helote."
1237757,"And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul. ",Ikalima na araw am o panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a meyngaran so Ananiya kano aro a kamanrarakehan a kano meyngaran si Tetolo a mapacicici a nimai do Kaysadiya kangay da do kabtekan da panirsirngen a meyngaran so Veydise a manci no karatan ni Pawlo. 
1237758,"And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, ","Karahan am powboten da si Pawlo do pacicicyan a kapanci na no aro a karatan na ni Pawlo ni Tetolo. Maniring am, ""Mo Veydise a panirsirngen, imo rana am yaka tey mateneng a mimong nyamen. Am ori o namen ikapiya do keymiminili namen. Yaro yapiya vazay mo do keymiminili namen. "
1237759,"we accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. ",So namen sarayan no karilawan mo nyamen. 
1237760,"Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. ",Yabo a yamasalit a ko isanga jimo am amizngen mo pa o alinged a ciring namen. 
1237761,"For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: ","Namen katenngan si Pawlo a na yapwan no ipeyvonag no tao do Yotay do peycyamahamahatawan na, a panirsirngen da no tao a yaomanoyong ji Yeso a tao do Nasale. "
1237762,"who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. ","Iya rana am nimanara so beken a tao do Yotay a somdep do rako a panaralayan. Am ori o namen nirakpan sya. [Naknakmen namen o kahap namen so iwawalam namen a oyyan namen nya am, "
1237763,"But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, ",mina kazazat na jyamen no panirsirngen no itaysang a meyngaran si Disiya. 
1237764,"commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. ","Na nipanci yamen ni Disiya o kangay namen ni Pawlo jimo.] Si pacicin mo o tao ito am to mo na tenngi o peypeypangayan no nirakpan namen sya."" "
1237765,"And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.",O macikaop rana jira tao do Yotay am mamimin sira amraherahet si Pawlo. To da macyanoyngi o nipanci na ni Tetolo.
1237766,"Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: ","No kano nang am nipya na ni Veydise si Pawlo a manci no kanoyngan na. Maniring si Pawlo am, ""Ko katenngan imo a yarana meyyawawan a yatomalamozong no pongso ta ya. Am ori o ko sarayan nimo a pacisirsirngan a yamanci no kabo no karatan ko. "
1237767,"because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. ",Jyabo mo kaji makatenngan do mina vazay ko no kangay ko a meynozi do Yelosaleng a. 
1237768,"And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: ",Jyabo kanimakacita da jyaken do rako a panaralayan a macingasangas do aro a tao a. Jyabo kanimakacita da jyaken a nimapeyvonag so tao do peyneynozyan a kado rarahan a. 
1237769,neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. ,So na ikabo no yongkad no da iraherahet jyaken. 
1237770,"But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: ",Am yasa ka vazay pa o ko ji naywa jimo. Ori rana am ko anoyngan o da iraralay no ineynapo namen. Ko anoyngan o iwawalam ni Moyse a kano nivatvatkan da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to. So na ikanoyong no ko kahap so yada ipanci a malas a nanao. 
1237771,"and have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. ","Ko akman sira yaomanoyong do keypirwa da mavyay no nimawakwak rana tao, tana marahet a tana yapya so vazay a tao am to sira meyyangangay a mirwa mavyay. "
1237772,"And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men. ",Am ori o ko ikakdekdeng a mahap so yapiya vazay do tangain ni Ama ta do to a kado tangain no tao.
1237773,"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. ","""Yarana meyyawawan o ko nikarwan do Yelosaleng. Am o ko nipeysinaoli a mangay do Yelosaleng am ko yangay o kingking da no akma koy kakteh do cinai a da isidong so tao do Yelosaleng. So nyangay ko pa do rako a panaralayan a mapatanang so nakem ko si Ama ta do to. "
1237774,"Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. ",Mateyka ko a mahap so iwawalam namen am nimacita da yaken no tao do rako a panaralayan. Am abo tao a nipeyvonag ko. 
1237775,"Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. ",No kanang am amyan do dang so tao do Yotay a apo do Yasiya. Inaoy no yasira myan do jya a manci no karatan ko. 
1237776,"Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council, ",Am ipanci da pala no yamyan jya a panipanirsirngen o ko karatan a nimamizing da ciring ko do rako a peykeykaygyan do Yelosaleng. 
1237777,"except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.","Ko naknakmen am yakmey yasa da pacioyyan jyaken, do mina kapanci ko no kanoyong ko do keypirwa no nimawakwak a tao a mavyay."""
1237778,"And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. ","Si Veydise rana am katenngan na o vazay da no amraralay ni Yeso. Am ori o ji na nimyai rana so tao a meyzezyak. Maniring do mangamizing a tao am, ""Nanalahen ta pa o panirsirngen no itaysang a meyngaran so Disiya a kapacici ko na jimo."" "
1237779,"And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.",Karahan am ipanci na o itaysang a amzat ji Pawlo a kapya da so kagagan na tomazogaw nya. So ji da nimvaoji pa sya no kanang.
1237780,"And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. ",Kadadayan na so araraw am mai sira Veydise a kano mavakes na a tao do Yotay a meyngaran so Tosila a omrara si Pawlo a manci no peypeypangayan na no kanoyong na ji Yeso Kizisto. 
1237781,"And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. ","Karahan am ononongan na rana ni Pawlo jira a meyyaven do vahay o kapiya no icicirawat a omzat do onowned mangay do ikarateng no araraw na no ipeykapyapinpin na so tao ni Ama ta do to. Mamizing na ori ni Veydise am manyahey rana o onowned na. Maniring ji Pawlo am, ""Angay rana. No ipanci ko imo am mai ka."" "
1237782,"He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. ",O pancyan na no akman sang am kakzeben na si Pawlo a mantan nya so nizpi. Am ori o ikasangib na amrara si Pawlo.
1237783,"But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.","Marateng o kadwa kawan am palitan na si Veydise no meyngaran so Pocyo Veyseto a meypanirsirngen. Am ikongo do kakzeben na ni Veydise no kaglaw da nya no tao do Yotay, am ori o ji na nimapasawai si Pawlo do pamemtengan."
1237784,"Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from C&#230; sarea to Jerusalem. ",Macipalit o kabtekan da do Kaysadiya a panirsirngen a meyngaran so Veyseto am mangay rana do Yelosaleng do ikatlo na araw. 
1237785,"Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him, ","O panipanirsirngen da rana no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan da no tao do Yotay am mangononong sira so malas a iraherahet da si Pawlo, "
1237786,"and desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. ",a kapanci da ni Veyseto a omya so tao a mangay ni Pawlo do Yelosaleng. Ta naknakmen da o kavat da ji Pawlo do rarahan a zakaten da sya. 
1237787,"But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at C&#230; sarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither. ","Am maniring jira si Veyseto am, ""Yapa myan si Pawlo do pamemtengan do Kaysadiya. Cyaha, ta makeykai ko a meysinaoli do dang. "
1237788,"Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.","So pancyan nyo no kamanrarakehan a macihza jyaken a kapanci da no karatan no tao ang, no si makaranes sira do dang."""
1237789,"And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto C&#230; sarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought. ",Mina kapito araw si Veyseto a nimyan do dang a kapeysinaoli na rana a mangay do Kaysadiya. Ikadwa na araw am iwangan na o pacicicyan a kai da rana ni Pawlo do tangain na. 
1237790,"And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove. ",Mai rana si Pawlo am o apo do Yelosaleng aro a tao am limoten da a kapanci da no itawwen da ciring a iraherahet da sya. Am abo do dang o manoyong a ciring da. 
1237791,"While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against C&#230; sar, have I offended any thing at all. ","So nitovisan na jira ni Pawlo. Maniring am, ""Yabo o ko mina vazay a yamacisala do iwawalam namen a tao do Yotay. Ko jya niraherahet o rako a panaralayan namen do Yelosaleng a kano rako a panirsirngen ta do Loma."" "
1237792,"But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? ","Am kakdain na ni Veyseto o karilaw da nya no tao do Yotay. Maniring ji Pawlo am, ""Manngwa, apyahen mo o kangay mo do Yelosaleng a pacicin ko dang an?"" "
1237793,"Then said Paul, I stand at C&#230; sar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest. ","Maniring si Pawlo am, ""Ko myan do tangain mo a yamo pacicin sicyaraw eya a nitovoy ni Kaysa a panirsirngen no Loma. So ko to ngyani do jya pacicin mo. Yamo katenngan yaken a yabo so yacinaratan do tao do Yotay. "
1237794,"For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto C&#230; sar. ","No si myan so kalasan ko a jya niomonot do iwawalam ta am cyaha, to nyo na zakata yaken. Am si abo o kalasan ko am ji ko mya o kapacici da jyaken no tao do Yotay. Si Kaysa apyahen ko a mapacici jyaken."""
1237795,"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto C&#230; sar? unto C&#230; sar shalt thou go.","Mateyka ni Veyseto a ahesen o kararay na am maniring ji Pawlo am, ""No mo ikakza o mo kangay do rako a panirsirngen do Loma am to ko na novoya imo a mangay dang."""
1237796,And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto C&#230; sarea to salute Festus. ,"Kadadayan na so araraw am mangay si Aglipa a panirsirngen a kano mavakes a meyngaran si Peynici do Kaysadiya a somaray ni Veyseto, do mina kapamnek da jya panirsirngen da. "
1237797,"And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix: ","Makanateng o araraw no niyan da dang am ipanci na rana ni Veyseto o vazay ni Pawlo ji Aglipa. Maniring am, ""Yamyan jya so yasa ka tao a nipteng na ni Veydise. "
1237798,"about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him. ",No kangay ko do Yelosaleng am amyan so ciring a niraherahet da sya no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a kano kamanrarakehan da no tao do Yotay. Ipanci da yaken a omzakat sya. 
1237799,"To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him. ","Am maniring ko jira am, 'No pangozayan o iwawalam no tao do Loma am no jya nipacici pa kabo no asa ka ciring a nipanci na a omagaz do karatan na am masalit o kato wakwakan so akman sang a tao.' "
1237800,"Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth. ","No kai da am ji ko nipeyyahahay, ta ikadwa na araw am iwangan ko o pacicicyan a kapacici ko si Pawlo. "
1237801,"Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed: ",Patwawen da o iraherahet da si Pawlo a ciring da am abo do teywara o karatan na do amizngan ko sya. 
1237802,"but had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. ",O da oyyan nya am ji na nionotan o iwawalam da no tao do Yotay. Ta onotan na o asa ka tao a meyngaran si Yeso a nimawakwak rana. Am ipanci na ni Pawlo o kanimirwa na mavyay no nang. 
1237803,"And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters. ","O akman rana sya a vazay am ko jyatenngi o ko ahahapan sya. Pacicin ko si Pawlo am, 'Manngwa, apyahen mo kangay mo do Yelosaleng a pacicin an?' "
1237804,"But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to C&#230; sar. ","Am jyakey si Pawlo, ta ikakza na o rako a panirsirngen ta do Loma a mapacici sya. Maniring ko ji Pawlo am, 'No komwan am to mo na panala o araraw no angayan da nimo do Loma.'"""
1237805,"Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.","Maniring si Aglipa ji Veyseto am, ""Amizngen ko pala o ciring na."" Maniring si Veyseto am, ""Amizngen mo simaraw."""
1237806,"And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth. ",Ikadwa na araw am nimai si Aglipa kani Peynici a meyyayob so apiya ayob da somdep do rako a peykeykaygyan. O macihza rana jira am panipanirsirngen no itaysang a kano maizay a tao do ili da. Meyratateng am nipanci ni Veyseto o tao a mai ni Pawlo. 
1237807,"And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. ","Maniring si Veyseto do aro a tao am, ""O tao rana ya am oya o yada ipanci a zakaten no tao do Yotay do Yelosaleng a kado jya. "
1237808,"But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him. ",Nyamizing ko na o ciring na am abo teywara a karatan na. O na ikakza no tao eya am pacicin no rako a panirsirngen do Loma. Am ori o ko na to novoi sya mangay do Loma. 
1237809,"Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write. ","Am yabo o ko nivatvatkan a karatan na a citahen no panirsirngen no Loma. Am ori o ko nyayyan nya jimo, mo Aglipa a panirsirngen namen, a ka ninyo a aro a tao a yaomamizing sya. Ta sidongen nyo pa yaken a manci no karatan na, kavatvatek ko jya. Ta ori o iyan no vatvatkan ko a citahen no panirsirngen do Loma. "
1237810,"For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.","Ta no ko naknakmen am no ji pa tenngi o karatan no nirakep a tao am marahet o kato rana novoyan sya do rako a panirsirngen ta."""
1237811,"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: ","Maniring si Aglipa ji Pawlo am, ""Ji ka nig a manci no ciring mo."" So nipaztaznekan na so lima na ni Pawlo a manci no ciring na."
1237812,"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: ","Maniring am, ""Ko masaray a yameytatanek do tangain mo, mo Aglipa a panirsirngen, a yamanci no da raherahetan jyaken no tao do Yotay. "
1237813,especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. ,Ta mo katenngan o iwawalam da no tao do Yotay a kano da kazyakan nyaken. Am ori o amizngan mo so ciring ko.
1237814,"My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; ","""O iwawalam ko no kalyalikey ko, na kai sicya rarakeh ko na ya do ili namen a kado Yelosaleng am yada mamimin a katenngan no tao do Yotay. "
1237815,"which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. ",No si manakem da o mina vazay ko no kakwa am anoyngan da rana yaken a tey makdeng so nakem a tao a macyagom do Vadisay a ji mapasala do iwawalam namen a tao do Yotay. 
1237816,And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers: ,"Sicyaraw rana ya am ko myan do tangain nyo a nyo pacicin, ta ko anoyngan o kanoyong na no nipanci na ni Ama ta do to do ineynapo ta do keypirwa da mavyay no nimawakwak a tao. "
1237817,"unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. ","Iya o yata pananalahen a sivosivovoong da no rarwa so ikakarwan a ineynapo ta, do ta kararalay ni Ama ta do to. Mo panirsirngen, ori o peypeypangayan no da rakpan jyaken no keylyan ta. "
1237818,"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead? ",Am inyo rana a tao do Yotay am ikongo nyo ji nganoyngi ji Ama ta do to a mapeyvangon so nimawakwak rana tao.
1237819,"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. ","""No kakwa pa am abo ji ko peyvazaya a izakat ko so tao a omamizing so nanao ni Yeso a tao do Nasale. "
1237820,"Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. ",Ori o mina vazay ko no keyyan ko pa do Yelosaleng. Nipya da yaken no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a omrakep so omanoyong ji Yeso a tao. No kapanzakat da jira am to ko myapya. 
1237821,"And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.",Masangib ko sira a pakakasin do peyneynozyan da a kapanci ko nira omalalas ji Yeso a iraralay da. So nikakdeng ko a macioya jira. Tomakatakaw kangay ko do teyhesa ka ili a mapakakasi sira.
1237822,"Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, ","""Ipisa nipya da yaken no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to a mangay do Tamaseke. "
1237823,"at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. ",Amyan ko do rarahan do peyignan no araw am to ko makacita so maniray apo do teyngato a mazngazngang pa kano araw a komowap jyaken a kano kararay ko. 
1237824,"And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.","So nikamimin namen a nimavazakwang do teyrahem a nimakowap. Meyratateng am makamizing ko so ciring no Sipolay a tao. Maniring jyaken am, 'Sawlo, Sawlo, ikongo yamo pakakasyan jyaken. Jyabo o kapakaharag mo jyaken a. Ta rakorako o oyowyat ko a ka nimo.' "
1237825,"And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.","Maniring ko jya am, 'Mo Panirsirngen, sino ka.' Maniring am, 'Yaken rana am si Yeso ko a mo pakakasin. "
1237826,"But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;",Peyvangon rana a kapeylimwang mo nyaken a nimapacita jimo. Ta yaken rana am yako nipamnekan imo a mahap so vazay ko. So peylimwangan mo no meypanam pa vazay a itoro ko jimo. 
1237827,"delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, ","Ko tovoin imo a meylimwang nyaken do tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay. No si myan so omraherahet jimo am cyaha, ta apzatan ko imo. "
1237828,"to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.","Ko tovoin imo a omiwang do mata da kapakacita da rana so kazngangan a komaro do vazay ni Satan a omanoyong rana ji Ama ta do to. So ikanoyong da rana mavonas so raraten a macikaop do amraralay nyaken a tao,' kwan na yaken ni Yeso."
1237829,"Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: ","""Am ori mo Aglipa a panirsirngen, o ko to mangozai do yana nipanci jyaken ni Yeso no kapakacita ko sya. "
1237830,"but shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Jud&#230; a, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. ","Nimanma na do Tamaseke a kado Yelosaleng o nyangayan ko a kangay ko na do peycyeylilyan na do Yotay a kado peyilyan da no beken a tao do Yotay amvavaga jira a komaro do peyraratenan da a somazap si Ama ta do to a mapacita rana no apiya icicirawat da, do kanoyong da rana nimamlis. "
1237831,"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me. ","Ikongo do nimangnanao ko do beken a tao do Yotay, am ori o nirakpan da jyaken no tao do Yotay do rako a panaralayan a vovwan a zakaten. "
1237832,"Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: ",Yato ngai sicyaraw eya o na nisidongan jyaken ni Ama ta do to a meylimwang no ciriciring na do meynakem a tao a kano ipangoyongoyod da tao. O nipeylimwang ko am meyyangay a kano nipeylimwang ni Moyse a kano panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to no kakwa. 
1237833,"that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.","Ta o nipeylimwang da da Moyse am manoyong keyyan no alalaw ni Kizisto a wakwaken da. So ika iya na no ney manma na a nimirwa a mavyay. Ta iya o mapatazadang jyaten a tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay."""
1237834,"And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.","Ji na pa teyka ni Pawlo o ciring na am to na amizing si Veyseto a amlololos. Maniring am, ""Ka zomyak eya an? Ta yateywara rana o mo naknakmen a vazay."" "
1237835,"But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. ","Maniring si Pawlo am, ""Ko ikamo imo mo Veyseto panirsirngen am jyabo ko kazyak a. Yamanoyong saon o ciring ko ang."" "
1237836,"For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. ","Maniring si Pawlo ji Aglipa am, ""Mo katenngan o akman sang a vazay. Am ori o ko jyamogawi a yamapatwaw sya jimo. Ta o akman rana sya a vazay am abo makatayo sya. "
1237837,"King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.","Mo Aglipa a panirsirngen, mo anoyngan o ciring da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to no kakwa pa? Ko katenngan mo kanoyong jya."" "
1237838,"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.","Maniring si Aglipa ji Pawlo am, ""Mo panopen yaken a yaomanoyong ji Kizisto?"" "
1237839,"And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.","Maniring si Pawlo ji Aglipa am, ""Tana mahay rana am to ko meynozyan nimo a kano aro a mangamizing a tao do jya a kamimin nyo rana akman jyaken a omanoyong jya. Am ji nyo nginara yaken a da aptengen!"""
1237840,"And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: ",Mamizing na ni Aglipa kani Veyseto a kano meyngaran so Peynici a mavakes a kano aro a tao a mangamizing am mina to sira meytatanek a makowbot do pantaw. 
1237841,"and when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. ","Amyan rana sira do pantaw am maniring sira do kadwan jira am, ""Ikongo peypeypangayan no kato tamtengan sya, kato ta wakwakan sya."" "
1237842,"Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto C&#230; sar.","Maniring si Aglipa ji Veyseto am, ""No ji na nipanci no tao eya o kangay na ji Kaysa a panirsirngen no Loma am jyabo o kaji ta mapasawayan sya."""
1237843,"And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band. ","Ikongo do nipamnekan da no panipanirsirngen o kangay da ni Pawlo do Itadi, am ori o nitorwan da ni Pawlo a kano aro a nipteng da do mimong no itaysang no Loma a meyngaran si Sodian. "
1237844,"And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. ",So nisakay namen do avang a nimapo do Atamityan a mangay do Yasiya a pongso. Nimacihza jyamen si Aditako a tao do Tesalonicya. O ili rana am macinapnap do Maciton. 
1237845,"And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself. ","Ikadwa na araw am makaranes namen do Siton. Ikongo do ikaglaw na si Pawlo ni Sodian, am ori o nipya na sya makarala a komala so kagagan na. "
1237846,"And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.",Karwan namen do Siton am izasen na yamen no rako a pagpag. Am ori o ninanad namen a mangay a macimazeveng so avang namen do Saypolose a pongso. 
1237847,"And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. ",Peyhavasan namen o ili do Cidicya kado Pangveydiya am makaranes namen do Mila a ili a macinapnap do Dicya. 
1237848,And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein. ,Makaranes namen dang am macita ni Sodian o asa ka avang apo do Adisanta a meypangay do Itadi. Karahan am ipanci na yamen a somakay do avang ang.
1237849,"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; ","O avang rana ori am tey mapakeh a somongay. Am ori o nikahay namen a makaranes do Kenito, ta ji namen a sangoz o pagpag. Am ori o mina to namen meyhavasi do Kedite a pongso a to namen paninida o avang do kehtengan na. Mownay am makaranes namen rana do kananayan do Samoni. "
1237850,"and, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.","Pandan namen rana nimapaninid so avang namen, do kaji namen makasangozan sya. Mownay am makaranes namen do ngaranan da Tey yapya a minato. O minato rana am macinapnap do Lasiya ili."
1237851,"Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, ","Makaranes namen rana dang am ilawden na. Am ori o nikainin namen. Maniring rana si Pawlo do aro a tao no avang am, "
1237852,"and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. ","""Manga keypong, ko citahen o palanginan am manginanawa ta no si meypangay ta. Jyabo kaji na kavan no avang ta. Ji na zyodan o aro a warawara do avang eya."" "
1237853,"Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. ",Am o mimong no itaysang a tao am apyapyahen na pa o kamizing na so mapasongay so avang a kano mapeyyavang sya. Ji na ngamiznga o ciring ni Pawlo. 
1237854,"And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.","No ahemyan am masakboz na o minato ang. Am ori o to da lovoci no tao no avang a manci no kapasongay so avang, ta tey kakza da o kapakaranes da do Venici do Kedite a pongso. Ta tey meymatek o minato do dang a nanalan da so kapiya rana no kakawan."
1237855,"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete. ",No kano nang am nimehteng pa. Am ori o ningingitan namen so ipanenbong namen a mangay rana. Am to namen paninida o avang namen do Kedite a pongso. 
1237856,"But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. ",So nikakeykai na nisangsang na. 
1237857,"And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive. ",Karahan am sibsiblakan na o avang namen. Ori o ji namen makasangozi sya. So to namen panowji rana sya. 
1237858,"And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat: ","Ikongo do nimacimazeveng namen do asa ka mahataw a ngaranan da so Kawtaw, ori o nikapya namen rana a mapasakay so tataloran. Karahan am pakedkeden namen rana do avang. "
1237859,"which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven. ","Mateyka namen rana pakedkeden o tataloran am imatkan namen no ovid o avang namen. Ta ihawa namen a makava. Ikongo do ikanyahey namen o avang a mangay somahag do kananayan do Siarti, am ori o nipakarwan namen so rako a vilad namen, kato namen rana macyocyozayan do angayan na nyamen no pagpag. "
1237860,"And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship; ","Ikongo do ji na heman no kakawan, am ori o to namen rana meywalici no karwan no warawara do avang do ikadwa na araw. "
1237861,and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. ,Ikatlo na araw am ji na pa ngehtengan. Am meywasik namen pa dang so maoran no avang ikarehmet na. 
1237862,"And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.","Nimownay namen a jya nimakacita so araw a kano mata no hanit, do kaji na ablisan no hangin. Am ori o to namen rana macirierisi."
1237863,"But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss. ","Ikongo do tey mownay namen a jya nimangakaday, am ori o nipeytatanek ni Pawlo. Maniring am, ""Kokay kamo.

1237864,"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. ",Am ko ipanci pa jinyo am ji kamo anyahey. Ta apya tamo. Am o avang ta ya am todabo rana makavakava. 
1237865,"For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, ","Ta si Ama ta do to rana a yako iraralay am nimanovoy so tinsi na no kamahep a yamanci nya jyaken. Yamaniring jyaken am, "
1237866,"saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before C&#230; sar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. ","'Mo Pawlo, ji ka onib.

1237867,"Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. ","Am ori o ji nyo anyahei, manga keypong an. Ta ko anoyngan si Ama ta do to a mangononong do ciring na jyaken. "
1237868,Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.,"Cyaha, ta amyan so asa ka likta pongso a kazadawan ta."""
1237869,"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country; ",Ikapat na so icyarwa (14) no araraw no niyan namen do karakwan no awa am to na rana pavyota yamen do meyngaran so Yatediya awa. Avak no ahep am ipanci da no tao no avang o kasngen namen rana do pamsan na. 
1237870,"and sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms. ",Paliwaten da o ovid a iktokto da do kararahem no awa am to ngyan so ikasi kapat na (40) anet no kararahem na. Ipirwa da aktoktwan am to ngyan so ikasi katlo na (30) anet. 
1237871,"Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.","Ikongo do ikanyahey da kasahag no avang, am ori o nipakasan da so apat a ka ipanenbong namen do maoji a omapanala so karaw na. "
1237872,"And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, ","Ikongo do meykagcigcin sira o tao no avang, am ori o nipagcinan da so tataloran da. Am o karwan da am mangay sira do morong na akmey mapagcin so ipanenbong. "
1237873,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. ","Am maniring si Pawlo do mimong no itaysang a kano macilolo jya itaysang am, ""No si somaway sira ito am jyabo kavyay ta."" "
1237874,"Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.",Am ori o nikteban da sya no itaysang so ovid no tataloran a kahatahataw na meyparai do avang ang.
1237875,"And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing. ","Meyzengazengang rana am ipanci na sira ni Pawlo a koman. Maniring jira am, ""Kamo kapat rana so icyarwa so araraw a yajya nimangakaday do nyo kalaw. "
1237876,Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. ,"Sijya kamo rana, ta koman ta na. Ta ori o iyan no oyowyat nyo. Cyaha, ta apya ta."" "
1237877,"And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat. ",Teyka na o ciring na am mangap si Pawlo so myanpaw a kasaray na nya ji Ama ta do to do tangain da kakcikcil na sya kanen. 
1237878,"Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat. ",So ji da na mogawi a koman rana. 
1237879,And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.,Yamen rana nimaoran do avang a tao am namen nanem so ikakawaowan so ikakatlwan na poo (276). 
1237880,"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. ","Teyka namen rana koman am pipowa da rana o nimavezed a mogi, ta ihepaw da do avang."
1237881,"And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. ",Penzak rana am ji da singkaji no tao no avang o pongso am macita da o kananayan. Ikakza da o kangay da mapanbong so avang da do dang. 
1237882,"And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. ",Karahan am akteben da o ovid no panenbong da kowvay da so ovid a iktan no savilak a kangingit da so vilad do morong na kapavyot na so avang do pasalan. 
1237883,"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.",Karahan am mangay somahag o avang namen a kaji na rana makapeygonagonayan a kakavakava no maoji na sibsiblakan na no rako azda.
1237884,"And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. ","Naknakmen da no itaysang o kazakat da so nipteng da tao, ta ihawa da sira meyyawawat a somaway. "
1237885,"But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land: ","Am o mimong no itaysang am ikarilaw na si Pawlo. So ji na nimyai sira amwakwak sira. Maniring rana do aro a aptengen da tao am, ""Inyo rana yamakeykeyyawat am peyyawat kamo na mangay do pamsan na."" "
1237886,"and the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.",O macikavang jira tao am amyan jira so mangap so tapi. Amyan jira so mangap so oraoran no avang a peyyawatan da. Am ori o nikamimin namen rana nimeyyawawat a mangay do pamsan na.
1237887,"And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. ",Makarala namen rana do pamsan na am katenngan namen rana o kapongpongso na a ngaranan da so Maarta. 
1237888,"And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.",No kanang rana am macimoy a karekmeh na. Am apya sira dang o meyili a tao. Ta nitaotao da yamen a kapeydokdok da nyamen so apoy a panangdangan namen. 
1237889,"And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. ","Pangain na ni Pawlo o nikpeh na kayo do panangdangan namen am makowbot o mavowaw, ta nikakwatan a kalavicin na do lima na a somongit sya. "
1237890,"And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. ","Macita da no meyili dang a tao am maniring sira am, ""Yajya nimangap so tao ya. Tana yaji nimawakwak ya do karakwan no awa am oya rana na masapa a alalaw na, do na kapeyraraten."" "
1237891,"And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. ",Karahan am toktoken na rana ni Pawlo o mavowaw do apoy am abo o nipeyzazan na. 
1237892,"Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.","To da pananala no aro a tao o kalipad no lima na, kawakwak na am abo imeymonan da sya. Am ori o nipeyzokaban da nya. Maniring rana sira am, ""Ala tao do to ya?"""
1237893,"In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. ",Amyan dang so tao a macisngen so nihakawan a meyngaran si Popaydi a panirsirngen da. Macita na yamen am yangay na yamen do vahay da a taotawwen so katlo araw. 
1237894,"And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. ",No kanang am nimeyngen o velek na ni ama na ni Popaydi a kapeyingwat na pa sya. Mangay jya si Pawlo am paoptahen na o lima na do kataotao na a meynozi nya. Ori o nikapya na rana. 
1237895,"So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: ",Mamizing da o vazay ni Pawlo no tao do dang am meykayyai o meykeyngeyngen a tao. So ikamimin da apya rana a nipeynozi ni Pawlo. 
1237896,"who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.",Nimacipinda no kanang o kanig da nyamen no tao. Karwan namen rana sira am aro o apzapzatan a nitoro da jyamen a paciralayan namen a mangay do asa ka avang.
1237897,"And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. ",Mavitos rana o katlo a vehan am mavang namen do asa ka avang apo do Yadisanta a nimanbong dang do karahet no kakawan do ahemyan. O avang rana ori am ngaranan da so Adwa ka tao do to. 
1237898,"And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. ",Makaranes rana o avang do Silako a ili am nimeywalam namen dang so katlo araw. 
1237899,"And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: ",Karwan namen dang am mangay namen rana do Leciang. Ikadwa na araw am somazawsaw. Am ori o nipavyotan na jyamen so kasaraw a kapakaranes namen rana do Potidi a ili. 
1237900,"where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. ",Makarahan am makasazi namen do dang so akma nameney kakteh do cinai. Nipeyseysan da yamen so kapito araw a kalam namen mangay rana do Loma. 
1237901,"And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.",Mamizing da yamen no amyan do Loma akma nameney kakteh do cinai am mangay da tazapyahen yamen do rako a panazangan a ngaranan da a Yapio. O karwan da am nimangay sira do ngaranan da so Meykatlo a iseysanan a ili a tomazapya jyamen. Macita na sira ni Pawlo am isaray na ji Ama ta do to. Ta nikaitan o onowned na. 
1237902,"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. ",Makaranes namen do Loma am apyahen da si Pawlo a kano amzat jya itaysang a meyvahay do asa ka vahay.
1237903,"And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. ","Ikatlo na araw am lovoten na sira ni Pawlo o panipanirsirngen da no tao do Yotay. Maniring jira si Pawlo am, ""Manga kahakay, yaken rana am tana ko jya niraherahet o keylyan ta a yajya nimapasobna do iwawalam no ineynapo ta am da todey amtenga yaken do Yelosaleng a da kangay nyaken do panirsirngen no Loma a pacicin. "
1237904,"Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. ",No kapacici da jyaken am ji da kala o karatan ko a izakat da jyaken. Ori o naknakman da so kapasaway da jyaken. 
1237905,"But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto C&#230; sar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. ",Am raten da no keylyan ta tao do Yotay. Am ori o to ko na manci nya so kangay ko do tangain ni Kaysa. Am yabwata o yasa ka ciring a ko iraherahet so keylyan ta tao do Yotay. 
1237906,"For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. ","Am ori o ko kakzeban jinyo a yapacisirsirngan. Ta o da nivaodan jyaken am yaomagaz do ko kanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto a yarana mownay a da pananalahen no Isedi a tao."""
1237907,"And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Jud&#230; a concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. ","Maniring sira ji Pawlo am, ""O akman rana sang a vazay mo am yabo namen nimahap a teygami apo do ili nyo a omagaz jimo. Yabwata do keylyan nyo o asa ka tao a nimapo do dang a yamraherahet jimo. "
1237908,"But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.","Am pancyan pala jyamen, ta namen katenngan inyo a yamraralay ni Yeso a da pacioyyan no aro a tao do peycyeylilyan na."""
1237909,"And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. ",Meyratateng am mamnek sira so kasaraw a ipeylovolovot da so tao a omamizing so ciring ni Pawlo. Marateng rana o araraw na am aro sira o tao a nimai a omamizing so ciring ni Pawlo.

1237910,"And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. ",O nipanci na ciriciring am amyan so tao a niomanoyong jya. Amyan so ji nganoyong jya. 
1237911,"And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, ","So ipeytaretarek no nakenakem da. Am ori o to da na meysyasyai. No kaji da pa meysyasyayan am maniring si Pawlo jira am, ""Manoyong o nipanci no Seyzi do ineynapo ta a nivatvatkan ni Isayya a panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to. "
1237912,"saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; And seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:","Maniring si Isayya am, 'Mey mo ipanci do aro a tao an. Manoyong o kamizing nyo sya am ji nyo a tenngi. Macita nyo am ji nyo a pengkad."
1237913,"For the heart of this people is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes have they closed; Lest they should see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should be converted, And I should heal them.","Ta tey masalit o onowned da no tao eya.

Ta ori o ipatazadang ko sira do teyngato.'"""
1237914,"Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. ","Maniring pa si Pawlo am, ""Inyo rana am anoyngan nyo si Ama ta do to a yarana mapatazadang so beken a tao do Yotay no ciriciring na, do da kapeyhanhan nya."" "
1237915,"And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.",[Teyka na o ciring ni Pawlo am to sira na meycyangangay o tao do Yotay. So nikapanes da a somkad do kadwan jira.]
1237916,"And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, ","Mina kadwa kawan si Pawlo a nimeyvahay do nivood na vahay a kasaray na a tomaotao so mey manangangay nya tao, "
1237917,"preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.",a kapangnanao na no italamozong na ni Ama ta do to a kano omagaz ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. So ikabo no ikamogaw na. So ikabo rana no itaysang a omza sya a meylimwang no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to.
1237918,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, ",Yaken rana am si Pawlo ko a lamlamsoy ni Yeso Kizisto. Na nipamnekan yaken ni Yeso Kizisto a amlivolivon no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237919,"(which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures, ) concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; ",O Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am nipatwaw da no panoyonoywan na so ciring na do nivatvatkan da Seysyo no kakwa pa a omagaz do Anak na si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta.

No hapen do itetngehan ta do tao am iya o sivovoong na ni Tawey. 
1237920,"and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: ",No hapen do ka Tao do to na am iya o nipeyvangon na ni Ama ta do to a nimapo do heseb na. So ikanoyong na Anak na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237921,"by whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: ","Am ori o ko pangozayan do ngaran na a yamahap so vazay na yamapanop so tao a yaomanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto do peycyamahamahatawan na, "
1237922,among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: ,a pacizanodan nyo a tao do Loma a yana nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to a italamozong na ni Yeso Kizisto.
1237923,"to all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.",Am ori o yako peyteygamyan ninyo a na tey karilaw ni Ama ta do to a tao do Loma a yamanoyong a na italamozong ni Ama ta do to. Inaoy si itoro na o pangangarilawan na kano ikapiya no onowned nyo ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta.
1237924,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. ","Ney manma na am ko isaray ji Ama ta do to si Yeso Kizisto, ta o nyo peyhanhanan nya am yada rana peyrengarengayan no tao do peycyamahamahatawan na. "
1237925,"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; ","Na katenngan ni Ama ta do to o ko kasangib a yameynozi ninyo, do yako ikowyat a yamahap so vazay na yameylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring no Anak na. "
1237926,"making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. ",Ko jimtad a yameynozi ji Ama ta do to do kapeypalanginan na nyaken. So yangay ko jinyo do dang. 
1237927,"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; ","Inaoy si macita ko inyo a kananao ko jinyo a kowyat nyo na meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to, do kasidong na jinyo no Seyzi. "
1237928,"that is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. ",Ala apyapya o kapanci ko no kapasipayyait ta so onowned ji Ama ta do to.
1237929,"Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto, ) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. ","Yako masangib a yamnakenakem so yako kangay jinyo manga kakteh. Am na katey aro no yamzazat jyaken. Am ori o ko jyangai jinyo do dang. Ta ko ikakza inyo a nanawen a kapeyparo da no tao a omanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto do dang, akman so niomanod a beken a tao do Yotay no keyyan ko pa do ili da no beken a tao do Yotay. "
1237930,"I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. ",Tana ko macizavoz do meykataretarek a tao am meyyangangay sira ori a yako sidongen no Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237931,"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. ",Am ori o ko ikakman sang a yamakza no kapeylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to jinyo a yameyili do Loma a tao.
1237932,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. ",Ko ipeyhanhan o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Ta ori rana am oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to a omahap so omanoyong jya tao do kapyapyan. Oya rana am manmanma a nipeylimwang do tao do Yotay a kapacitonton da no beken a tao do Yotay. 
1237933,"For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.","Ta o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to o ipakateneng ta do kabnek na jyaten ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na. O yapwan na no nya am amyapo do kapeyhanhan ta nya. Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""O tao rana a abneken na ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na am mahap da o to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da."""
1237934,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; ",Nipaziman na rana ni Ama ta do to o rako a oyaoyyan na no meyraraten a tao a kano ji raralay nya tao. O raraten no tao am ori o yambonbon do yamanoyong a nanao na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237935,because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. ,"Pasingsingtan na sira ni Ama ta do to, ta nipaziman na rana ni Ama ta do to o vazay na do tangain da. So da ipakateneng rana jya. "
1237936,"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: ",Yajyacita si Ama ta do to. Am nimakalapo no kamamaog na so karawan o kaji na ablisan no ka Tao do to na. Ta apo do nyamamaog na o ipakateneng jya Tao do to arako so oyowyat. So ikabo no tao a omalalas jya. 
1237937,"because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. ","Am tana da katenngan si Ama ta do to am da ji raralayan, da ji narayan o aryarilaw na sira. So da icyakmey yamavota so onowned a yaji makateneng ji Ama ta do to. "
1237938,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, ","Sira mapakateneteneng. Am jyakman sang, ta yabwata da katatenngan. "
1237939,"And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.",Da ji raralayan o yato meyyonong a Tao do to. Da iraralay o da nipariparing a yakmey taotao a kano meyyasasalap a kano omalalam a kano makakaday a nipariparing da.
1237940,"Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: ",Am ori o to na rana macyozai ni Ama ta do to do onowned da a mapeyvazay so macimasesnek a raraten da. 
1237941,"who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. ","Da peymakarwan o manoyong a nanao na ni Ama ta do to a da kahap so malas a nanao amraralay no masaod no karawan a nyamamaog na ni Ama ta do to, a ji raralay no manoyong a Tao do to a nimangamamaog so makakaday. So ika si Ama ta do to na no to meyyonong a iraralay ta. Amin."
1237942,For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: ,O akman sang a vazay da am to na macipanadngi ni Ama ta do to o onowned da a somagpyan. Ta o mavakes rana am mangzakza sira so kehngehngay da no kolit. 
1237943,"and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. ","Sira akman sang o mahakay, ta da jyakzan o kapacitovong da do mavakes, ta ikeykakza da pa o kapacitovong da do icyamahakay da. Am ori o ipeydedna na jira no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to a ingingnen no kataotao da."
1237944,"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; ",Ji da ranakzan no tao o manoyong a nanao na ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o to na rana macipanadngi do onowned da a meyparahet a mapeyvazay so makararahet a vazay.

1237949,"Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. ",Yata katenngan o kanoyong na no oyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to no akman so sang a tao.

1237952,But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; ,Am yamo kakmey mavota so onowned a yaji mamlis.

1237958,for there is no respect of persons with God.,Ta si Ama ta do to rana am ji mapeykakaban so tao.
1237959,For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; ,"O iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to a nitaid na ji Moyse am abo ori do beken a tao do Yotay a pangozayan da.

1237965,"and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; ","Nyo katenngan o apya kano marahet, ta yamyan jinyo o iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to. "
1237966,"and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, ",Yanyo ipanci o yanyo kapangonong no mavota tao a yamangay do kazngangan.

1237968,"Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? ","Nyo nanawen o aro a tao. Am ikongo yanyo ji makananaoi so kataotao nyo. No kamo maniring am, ""Ji kamo manakaw,"" am kamo manakaw. "
1237969,"Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?

1237972,"For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. ",No kamo manoyong a yamahap so iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to am manoyong o keyyan no peypeypangayan no kayongkad do kataotao nyo. Am si ji nyo ngapa o iwawalam na am abwata peypeypangayan no kayongkad nyo do kataotao nyo.
1237973,"Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? ",Tana ji da yongkaji no beken a tao do Yotay o kataotao da am no ahapen da o iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to am jyabo kaji na pazanodan sira do nimyongkad do kataotao da a tao ni Ama ta do to a avyain na. 
1237974,"And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? ",So ikanoyong na a meydedna jinyo a tao do Yotay no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to.

1237975,"For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: ","Am sino manoyong a tao do Yotay a italamozong na ni Ama ta do to. Manngwa, nimyongkad do kataotao da? Beken a ori, ta o omanoyong jya tao am ori o italamozong na. "
1237976,"but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.","O manoyong a tao do Yotay am mamlis so onowned a omanoyong ji Ama ta do to. Ta ori rana am vazay na ori no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to. So ikabeken a kahap so iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to a nitaid na ji Moyse. O mahap na azwazway no nimamlis so onowned a tao am beken a apo do tao, ta apo ji Ama ta do to."
1237977,What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? ,No manoyong kakman na sang am ikongo peypeypangayan no ka tao do Yotay da kano kayongkad da do kataotao da. 
1237978,"Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. ",Yaro peypeypangayan no nang. O ney manma na am na nitoro jira ni Ama ta do to o ciriciring na. 
1237979,For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? ,"Tana yamyan jira so yatatasa yaji nganoyong do ciriciring na am cinakongo na. Manngwa, ablisen na pa o nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to? "
1237980,"God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, And mightest overcome when thou art judged.","Jyabo kakman na sang a.

1237981,"But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) ","Ala yamyan so tao a manci no, ""Apya o keyyan no raraten ta. Ta o raraten ta am ipakateneng da no tao ji Ama ta do to a ji meyraraten a kazwazway da sya.

1237982,God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? ,Beken a akman sang an. Ta no si malas o kapasingsingkad na jyaten ni Ama ta do to am makongo so wanjin a mapeykapyapinpin so tao do karawan.
1237983,For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? ,"Ala yamyan pa so tao a yamanci no, ""Si malas o ciring ko am jyabo kaji da makatenngan jya no tao si Ama ta do to a yajyalas so ciring a.

1237984,"And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say, ) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.","""Ikongo ta jyangai a meyraraten a kapeypapya ta nya."" So da iyan no tao a yamanci no kapeyciring ko so sang, do da karaherahet jyaken. So ikanoyong da no akman sang a tao a peydednan na no oyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to."
1237985,"What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; ","Manngwa, namen apyapya pa tao do Yotay a kano karwan no tao do tangain na ni Ama ta do to? Jyabo kakman na sang a. Nipanci ko na o tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay a yameyyangay a yameysaod pa so raraten. "
1237986,"as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:","Akman so ipanci na do Seysyo. Ta maniring am, ""Abwata o yasa ka tao abo so raraten."
1237987,"There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God.",Abwata o yasa ka tao a yamakateneng ji Ama ta do to. Yabo o yasa ka tao a yamakza no na kararalay ni Ama ta do to.
1237988,"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.",Yamamimin o tao a yamlikod ji Ama ta do to a yamangay do da peyraratenan. Yabo o yasa ka tao a apya so nakenakem.
1237989,Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit; The poison of asps is under their lips:,O ciriciring da am ikarahet no tao. Sya mangononong so yamalas. So na icyakmey mavowaw no ciriciring da a tey manginanawa.
1237990,Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:,Ta mamimin a ipangangavay o ciriciring da.
1237991,Their feet are swift to shed blood:,No meyoyaoya sira am panwakwakan da rana so tao.
1237992,Destruction and misery are in their ways:,O angayan da nira ori am abo o ji da peyrarehta tao.
1237993,And the way of peace have they not known:,Ji da tenngi o kapya no onowned da do icyatatao da.
1237994,There is no fear of God before their eyes.,"Ji da anyaheyan o peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to."""
1237995,"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. ",O iwawalam na ni Moyse am itoro na ni Ama ta do to do tao do Yotay a pangozayan da. So ikabo no tao do karawan a omalalas do raraten da do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. 
1237996,Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.,Abo asa ka tao a mangozay do iwawalam na ni Moyse a manoyong a manci no kabo no raraten na do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. Ta o iwawalam na ni Moyse am kapanidong na so tao a makateneng do raraten da.
1237997,"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; ","Sicyaikwaya am na rana nipananao jyaten o na kabnek jyaten ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na. Ori rana am beken a iwawalam na ni Moyse, ta monganay do kapeyhanhan ni Yeso Kizisto akman so mina ciring da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to. "
1237998,even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: ,Si ipeyhanhan ta si Yeso Kizisto am abneken na rana yaten ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na. So ipeyyangangay na no nang a itoro na do meyhanhan nya tao. 
1237999,"for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; ",Ta tanyo mamimin a yameyraraten a yaji makanet so nakenakem do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238000,being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: ,So na nitovoyan si Yeso Kizisto a yasomidong jyaten a komaro do raraten ta do na karilaw nyaten. So ikanoyong ta na abo so raraten do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238001,"whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; ",Nitovoy na si Yeso Kizisto a mangay mawakwak no raraten ta. So ikanoyong no meyhanhan nya tao a mavonas rana so raraten. O ikakman na sang ni Ama ta do to am ipacita na o kaji na alasan a mapeykapyapinpin so tao. Ta o pangangasyan na am ori o ji na rana mapasingsingkaji do meyhanhan nya tao no kakwa. 
1238002,"to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.",Am sicyaikwa rana ya am na nyahap ni Yeso Kizisto o raraten no tao. So ikanoyong da no meyhanhan nya tao a mavonas rana so raraten ji Ama ta do to a kabnek na sira a abo so raraten do tangain na. Ori na ikatey yapya no na ahahapan sya ni Ama ta do to.
1238003,Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. ,Am ikongo ipakazwazway ta. Jyabo a. O ko pancyan no nang am beken a ta kahap so iwawalam na ni Moyse o yata ikapya do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. Ta yaomagaz do yata kapeyhanhan ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1238004,Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. ,O ikabo no raraten no tao do tangain ni Ama ta do to am meykasaha. Ori rana am ipeyhanhan si Yeso Kizisto. So ikabeken a kahap ta so iwawalam na ni Moyse. 
1238005,"Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: ",Jyabo ka tao do Yotay no mapeytao do to si Ama ta do to a. Ta Tao do to da no beken a tao do Yotay. So na ikanoyong no nang. 
1238006,"seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. ","Yasa si Ama ta do to. O ikapya namen a tao do Yotay do tangain na am akman sang, ta inyo rana beken a tao do Yotay am no si anoyngan nyo si Ama ta do to am akman kamo sang a vonasen na so raraten. "
1238007,"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.","No akman sang am manngwa, todabo rana o oyowyat na no iwawalam na ni Moyse? Jyabo kakman na sang a. Ta o manoyong a meyhanhan ni Yeso Kizisto a tao am ori o ipanci a manoyong a mangononong do iwawalam na ni Moyse."
1238008,"What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? ",Naknakmen ta pala si Apolahan a manoyong a ineynapo namen a tao do Yotay. 
1238009,"For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. ",No si monganay do apya icicirawat na o abnekan na sya abo so raraten do tangain na ni Ama ta do to am manoyong kapakazwazway na nya. Am ji na mapazwayan do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238010,"For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. ","Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Na anoyngan si Ama ta do to ni Apolahan. Ori nibnekan na sya ni Ama ta do to do a abo so raraten do tangain na."""
1238011,"Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. ","O meyvazay a tao am manoyong o kapeynizpi sira. Am o nizpi da am beken a karilawan na nira no mapeyvazay sira, ta nizpi da do kapeyvazay da. "
1238012,"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. ",Am o nakenakem na jyaten ni Ama ta do to am beken a akman sang. Ta o meyhanhan nya tao am beken a monganay do kapya no icicirawat na. Ta o abnekan na sya abo so raraten ni Ama ta do to am monganay do kapeyhanhan na nya. 
1238013,"Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, ","O akman rana sang a tao am tey yapya an, ta ji monganay do apya icicirawat na o yana vonasan so raraten na. Ori o akman so nipanci ni Tawey. Maniring am, "
1238014,"saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, And whose sins are covered.","""O nivonas na rana so raraten ni Ama ta do to a tao am manoyong sira tey yapya o akman sang a tao."
1238015,Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.,"O ji na rana naknakma ni Ama ta do to so raraten a tao am tey yapya o akman sang a tao."""
1238016,"Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. ","O ipanci na ni Tawey a tey yapya a tao am manngwa, o nimyongkad do kataotao na o peycirngan na sya? Beken a ori an. Ta macyangay sira o jya nimyongkad do kataotao da. Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Na anoyngan si Ama ta do to ni Apolahan. Ori o nibnekan na sya ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten."" "
1238017,"How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. ",Ikongo nikapwan no akman sang. No kaji da pa nimyongkadan ji Apolahan an? No kateyka na rana niyongkadan da. Jyabo kaji na nimyapwan no kaji da niyongkadan do kataotao na. 
1238018,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: ","O peypeypangayan na no kayongkad da do kataotao na am nivonas na rana ni Ama ta do to o raraten na, ta nipeyhanhan na si Ama ta do to. Am ori nipancyan na nya abo rana so raraten. Ori o da abnekan si Apolahan a ama da no yameyhanhan ni Ama ta do to a tao. Tana ji da yongkaji o kataotao da am to na rana abneken sira abo so raraten do kapeyhanhan da ni Ama ta do to. "
1238019,"and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.","Akman sang, ta yada akmey ama no yarana niyongkadan do kataotao da tao. Am beken a yada kanimyongkad rana do kataotao da, ta yada inarahen pa si Apolahan a yameyhanhan ni Ama ta do to."
1238020,"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. ","O mina ciring na ni Ama ta do to ji Apolahan am itoro na o karawan ji Apolahan a kano sivosivovoong na. Am beken a kahap na ni Apolahan so iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to o peycirngan na sya, ta yamonganay do na kapeyhanhan ni Ama ta do to ni Apolahan. Ori nyabnekan na sya ni Ama ta do to abo so raraten do tangain na. "
1238021,"For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: ","Ta no si azawen na yaten ni Ama ta do to do kahap ta so iwawalam na ni Moyse am manngwa, abo saon o peypeypangayan no kapeyhanhan ta ni Ama ta do to. So ikabo na saon no peypeypangayan no mina ciring na jyaten am. "
1238022,"because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. ",O iwawalam na ni Moyse o yapwan no peyoyaoya na ni Ama ta do to. Ta abo yasa ka tao a manoyong a makahap sya. No abo pangozayan a iwawalam am do wanjin o kapwan no raraten no tao.
1238023,"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, ",O mina ciring na ni Ama ta do to so meyhanhan nya tao am to na palololwa do kapeyhanhan da nya. So ji na monganai do kapya no icicirawat ta. Ta o aryarilaw na ni Ama ta do to jyaten a sivosivovoong na ni Apolahan am ori o nipanci na a itoro na jyaten ni Ama ta do to. So ji ta mangozai do iwawalam na ni Moyse. Ta macyangay ta ji Apolahan a omanoyong ji Ama ta do to. Ta iya rana am akma tey ama a yameyhanhan ni Ama ta do to. 
1238024,"(as it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations, ) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. ","Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Ko abneken imo a ama da no tao do peycyamahamahatawan na."" So ipangononong na no ciring ni Ama ta do to. Ta o na anoyngan ni Apolahan a Tao do to am yamapeyvangon so nimawakwak a tao a nimangamamaog so karawan."
1238025,"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. ","Tana katenngan na o katey masalit na no keyyan no minapodpod jya do kararakeh na rana am na anoyngan o kapangononong na no mina ciring na jya ni Ama ta do to. Ta maniring si Ama ta do to jya am, ""Somaod ka so sivosivovoong."""
1238026,"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: ",Toda ji makapoo (100) o kakawakawan na am naknakmen na rana o kararakeh na ni Apolahan. O mavakes na meyngaran si Salay am ji rana makapeytaodtod ori. Am ji na haywan ni Apolahan o kapeyhanhan na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238027,"he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; ",Tana akman sang am ji na haywan o kararalay na ni Ama ta do to. Ta ikowyowyat na meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to a omazwazway sya. 
1238028,"and being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. ",Anoyngan na si Ama ta do to a mangononong do mina ciring na jya. 
1238029,And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. ,Am ori o nibnekan na sya ni Ama ta do to si Apolahan a abo so raraten do tangain na do kapeyhanhan na nya.
1238030,"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; ",Am beken a iyaha o peycirngan na so kabo no raraten na. 
1238031,"but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; ","Ta akman sang o ciring na jyaten, do yata kanoyong ji Ama ta do to a nimirwa a omvyay si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. So icyakman ta sang a abneken na ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na. "
1238032,"who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.",Nimawakwak si Yeso no raraten ta a kapirwa na rana mavyay. So ikanoyong ta na ipanci ni Ama ta do to abo so raraten do tangain na.
1238033,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: ",O na abnekan jyaten ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na am ta ipeyhanhan si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. So ikanoyong ta rana macikaop ji Ama ta do to. 
1238034,"by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. ","O ta ikakman sang sicyaikwaya am pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to, do ta kapeyhanhan ni Kizisto. Am ori o ikasaray ta, ta katenngan ta o kahap na jyaten ni Ama ta do to do teyngato a macikasaray do azwazway na. "
1238035,"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; ",Tana amyan so alalaw ta am masaray ta. Ta ori ipakateneng ta rana do ahapan ta sya no myan so alalaw ta. 
1238036,"and patience, experience; and experience, hope: ","Ta si myan rana so peyneynaran ta sya do alalaw ta am mowyat ta na so onowned a omnanala so itoro na jyaten ni Ama ta do to sarasaray ta, "
1238037,and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ,do kapeyhanhan ta ni Ama ta do to a mangononong do mina ciring na jyaten. Ta o Seyzi a nitoro na jyaten ni Ama ta do to am ori o yaomoyat do onowned ta a makateneng ta do pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to.
1238038,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. ",No kakwa pa am abo oyowyat ta a komaro do peyraratenan ta. Am kanimangozay na jya ni Kizisto do nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to a araraw a mangay mawakwak nyaten. 
1238039,For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. ,Yabo o tao a mawakwak no icyatatao na. Am ala yamyan so mawakwak no apiya so ahahapan sya tao. 
1238040,"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. ","Am no kapeyraraten ta pa am nikawakwak na yaten ni Kizisto. Ori rana am yongkad na ori ni Ama ta do to, do na karilaw nyaten. "
1238041,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. ",No ta manoyong rana a yanimavonas so raraten no rala ni Yeso Kizisto am abneken na rana yaten ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na. No si akman sang am maliklik ta o peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to no makwa. 
1238042,"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. ",No kakwa am abo o kasngesngenan ta ji Ama ta do to. Am mina kawakwak na nyaten no Anak na. Am ori o ta na ipacikaop ji Ama ta do to. No manoyong o akman sang am jyabo kaji na ngahapan jyaten a. Ta si Yeso Kizisto rana am yamyan do teyngato a yasomidong jyaten. 
1238043,"And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.",Tamo isaray ji Ama ta do to o na kanimapanop jyaten ni Yeso Kizisto ji Ama ta do to. Am ori o yata ipacikaop ji Ama ta do to. So ta na ikasaray do yana kanimahap ni Kizisto so vazay na ni Ama ta do to a yasomidong jyaten.
1238044,"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: ",Si Adam o yapwan no raraten do karawan. Am ori o nyangay na no inawan na do kapeyraraten na. Ori o nikapwan no kawakwak rana no tao do karawan. Ta yamamimin o tao a yameyraraten. 
1238045,(for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. ,"No kabo na pa no nitoro na ni Ama ta do to a iwawalam na ji Moyse am amyan rana so raraten no tao do karawan. Am o raraten no tao am ji pa mancyan a raraten da, ta abo pa o iwawalam a pangozayan da. "
1238046,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. ","Am no kabo pa no iwawalam na ni Moyse am amyan rana so tao a mawakwak. Tana ji sira akman si Adam a ji niomamizing si Ama ta do to am akman sira si Adam a mawakwak, ta amyan so raraten da. Si Adam am pehngehngain ji Yeso Kizisto. Am meytarek o pamoonen da do tao. "
1238047,"But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. ","Ta si Adam rana am nimeyraraten. Am ori o nikapwan no ikawakwak no tao. Am si Yeso Kizisto am tey mangarilaw, ta nikawakwak na o raraten no tao. O akman sang a pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a yana nitoro do aro a tao am yabo tonggal na. "
1238048,"And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. ","Meyraraten si Adam. Am ori o iyan no raraten no tao a mangay do kararatan. Am o meyhanhan ni Yeso Kizisto a tao am mavonas o raraten da, ta mahap da o pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o abnekan na rana sira abo so raraten do tangain na. "
1238049,"For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)",So ikanoyong na no raraten na ni Adam a yapwan no ikawakwak rana no tao. Am arakorako pa o pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto a yamapeyvaliw jyaten a abo so raraten do tangain na ni Ama ta do to a manta nyaten so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta.
1238050,Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. ,"So ikanoyong na no raraten na ni Adam a yapwan no kapeydedna no oyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to do tao do karawan. Akman sang, ta o kapyapya na ni Kizisto am ikamimin no meyhanhan nya tao a mavonas rana so raraten a ipakahap da rana so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da. "
1238051,"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. ",Yakman sang o aro a tao a omamoon so raraten ni Adam. Am kanyahap na rana ni Yeso Kizisto so vazay ni Ama ta do to a mawakwak no raraten ta. Am ori o ikamimin no tao a meyhanhan nya abneken na ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na.
1238052,"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: ",O nitoro ni Ama ta do to a iwawalam na ni Moyse am ipakateneng no tao do raraten da. Am tana akman sang am arakorako pa o aryarilaw na jyaten ni Ama ta do to. 
1238053,"that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.","No kakwa pa am niharag no raraten o tao do karawan. Am ori o ikamimin da mawakwak no tao. Am o pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to am na nitoro do meyhanhan nya tao. So ikamimin da rana vonasen na so raraten. So ipakahap da rana so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da, do da kanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta."
1238054,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? ","Manngwa, ji ta ngaroi o raraten ta a kato na ngarilawan nyaten ni Ama ta do to? "
1238055,"God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? ","Jyabo kakman ta sang a. Ta yatamo rana nikarwan o peyraratenan ta. Am manngwa, olin ta pa o peyraratenan taha? "
1238056,"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. ","Kamo jyamimin a makateneng do peypeypangayan no kataktak da jyaten. Ta ori rana am yongkad no kapacizanod no raraten ta a yakmey nimaciwakwak ji Yeso Kizisto. So icyakman ta sang a macizanod ji Kizisto a mirwa a mavyay. So ikanoyong ta na makahap so vayo rana icicirawat ta, akman si Yeso a nipirwa na avyain ni Ama ta do to no oyowyat na.Kamo jyamimin a makateneng do peypeypangayan no kataktak da jyaten. Ta ori rana am yongkad no kapacizanod no raraten ta a yakmey nimaciwakwak ji Yeso Kizisto. So icyakman ta sang a macizanod ji Kizisto a mirwa a mavyay. So ikanoyong ta na makahap so vayo rana icicirawat ta, akman si Yeso a nipirwa na avyain ni Ama ta do to no oyowyat na."
1238057,"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: ",No ta na macikaop ji Kizisto am yamyan pa so kapirwa na jyaten a avyain ni Ama ta do to no makwa. 
1238058,"knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. ",Tamo na katenngan o adan ta onowned a yarana akmey nimacizanod ji Kizisto a nipadket do jyojika. So ikanoyong ta na a nikomaro rana do raraten ta. So ikabo na rana no oyowyat no raraten a tomalamozong nyaten. 
1238059,For he that is dead is freed from sin. ,Ta no mawakwak rana o tao am ji na rana nalamozongan no raraten. 
1238060,"Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: ",No si nimacizanod ji Kizisto o adan ta onowned a nidomket do jyojika am anoyngan ta o kapacizanod ta ji Kizisto a mavyay. 
1238061,knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. ,Ta tanyo na katenngan si Kizisto a nimirwa a mavyay. So ji na rana wakwaki. Ta abo o oyowyat a makawakwak sya. 
1238062,"For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. ",Ipisa si Yeso a mawakwak no raraten ta tao. So na rana ipacikaop ji Ama ta do to a mavyay sicyaikwaya. 
1238063,"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.","Akman sang, ta naknakmen nyo o kapacizanod no adan a onowned nyo ji Kizisto a nimawakwak no raraten nyo. So ikanoyong nyo na a meypahagnat so onowned ji Ama ta do to, ta kamo rana macikaop ji Yeso Kizisto."
1238064,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. ",Am ori o ji nyo to amyapyai so kataotao nyo a italamozong no raraten. Ji nyo to ngonongonoci o marahet a onowned nyo. 
1238065,"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. ",Ji nyo mamyapyan o peyvongvongwan nyo a peylamlamsoin no raraten. Ta itoro nyo o kataotao nyo ji Ama ta do to a mahap so vazay na. O torwan nyo no kataotao nyo ji Ama ta do to am ahapen nyo o apya vazay na. Ta iya o na yapwan no vayo a inawan ta. 
1238066,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.",So ji na rana nalamozongi ninyo no raraten. Ta nyo na ipeyhanhan o pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a makavonas so raraten nyo. So ji na monganai do apya icicirawat nyo.
1238067,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. ","No akman sang am manngwa, apya saon o kato ta na meyraratenan a meyhanhan no pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a makavonas so raraten ta? Jyabo kakman ta sang a. "
1238068,"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? ","No onotan nyo o ciring no tao am manoyong kamo a lamlamsoy da. Akman sang, ta no si onotan nyo o raraten am manoyong kamo a lamlamsoy no raraten a mangay do kararatan. Am no si onotan nyo si Ama ta do to am abneken na inyo a abo so raraten do tangain na. "
1238069,"But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. ",Am ta isaray ji Ama ta do to. Ta no kakwa am akma ney lamlamsoy inyo no raraten. Am sicyaikwa rana ya am yasa rana o onowned nyo a yaomonot do manoyong a nanao. 
1238070,"Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. ",Am ori o ji na rana mapeylamlamsoi jinyo no raraten. So ikanoyong nyo na yamahap so apya vazay na ni Ama ta do to.
1238071,I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. ,"Abo o makdeng a ciring ko jinyo, ta ko ihawa inyo a ji makateneng jya. No kakwa pa am ji nyo amzaci o onowned nyo. Am ori o ikarahet no vazay nyo. So ikanoyong nyo akma ney lamlamsoy no raraten. Am sicyaikwa rana ya am itoro nyo o kataotao nyo ji Ama ta do to a mahap so vazay na. Ta ori o ji nyo rana meylimotengi so onowned a lamlamsoy na ni Ama ta do to."
1238072,"For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. ",No kapeylamlamsoy na pa jinyo no raraten am ji nyo akzan o kapeyvazay nyo so apiya vazay. 
1238073,What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. ,O yanyo ipacimanig rana sicyaikwaya a vazay am nipeyvazay nyo na. Am ikongo o na kapyapyan no akman sang. Kangay nyo saon do kararatan no akman sang am. 
1238074,"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. ",Am inyo rana sicyaikwaya am ji na rana peylamlamsoya inyo no raraten. Ta yanyo rana kakzeben si Ama ta do to a mapeylamlamsoy jinyo. So yanyo rana ipeyngongyod a yaomonot rana ji Ama ta do to. So ikanoyong nyo a makahap so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad nyo. 
1238075,For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.,Ta o kapalit no raraten am mangay do makotokotod a lila no apoy a mangay no makwa. Am o yazaw na ni Ama ta do to so yamacibedbed ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta am ipanta na so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da.
1238076,"Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law, ) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? ","Nyo jyatenngi, manga kakteh, o yokoyokod rana no tao do karawan eya am o mavyay a tao o kapyan na. Am no mawakwak rana tao am abo rana peypeypangayan na no yokoyokod do karawan. "
1238077,"For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. ",Akman so nimacivahavahay rana a mavakes. Ta no mavyay pa o kahanghangan na am ji na to ngaroi. Ta ori o adan a iwawalam no tao do karawan. No si mawakwak saon o kahanghangan na o ji na rana mangozai do iwawalam ori am. 
1238078,"So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. ","Am ori an, no meyigegen pa o kahanghangan na am ji to macitovong do karwan no tao. Ta o akman rana sang am somagpyan. Am no nimawakwak rana o kahanghangan na am ipanci rana ori no tao a to rana naliway. So ikapya na rana macivahavahay."
1238079,"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. ","Manga kakteh, yakamo akman sang a na rana ji nalamozongan no iwawalam na ni Moyse. Ta kanyo na macikaop ji Yeso Kizisto a nimawakwak no raraten nyo. Inyo rana sicyaikwaya am na rana ipeymatmatngeh inyo ni Yeso a yanimirwa a mavyay a Panirsirngen ta. Ta iya o manoyong a ahapen ta so vazay. "
1238080,"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. ",No kato ta pa mangozayan do adan a onowned ta a meyraraten am nipatwaw no iwawalam na ni Moyse o raraten ta do onowned ta. Am o kapalit no raraten am mangay do makotokotod a lila no apoy a mangay no makwa. 
1238081,"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.",Am sicyaikwa rana ya am na rana jyagogadan yaten no nivatvatkan a iwawalam na ni Moyse. Ta ori rana am adan rana ori. So ta na pangozayan do na ipananao jyaten no Seyzi a vayo a nakenakem ta ji Ama ta do to.
1238082,"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. ","No akman sang am manngwa, ipanci ta o iwawalam na ni Moyse a yapwan no raraten? Jyabo kakman na sang a. Ta o iwawalam na ni Moyse am ipakateneng ta do raraten. No abo iwawalam a yamanci no kaji mangagoman am jyabo ko kapakateneng do karahet no mangagom a. "
1238083,"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. ",Nimeycicinda jyaken o raraten a amyan. No ipanci no iwawalam na ni Moyse o kaji mangagoman am ikaraherahet ko a mangagom. No abo iwawalam na ni Moyse am jyabo kapakateneng ta do kapeyraraten ta. 
1238084,"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. ","No kaji ko pa makatenngan do iwawalam na ni Moyse am akmey abo raraten ko. Am katenngan ko na o iwawalam na ni Moyse am katenngan ko na o karahet no icicirawat ko, do kapakateneng ko rana do peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to do meyraraten a tao. "
1238085,"And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. ",Am o peypeypangayan no iwawalam na ni Moyse am ipakateneng no tao do to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad. Am o akman rana sang jyaken am yangay ko do kararatan. Ta yako jya nimataptap a yanipeyvazay no iwawalam na ni Moyse. 
1238086,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. ",Manoyong ko kakmey mavota no raraten. Am ori o ko nipasobnan do iwawalam na ni Moyse. So ikanoyong ko mangay do kararatan.
1238087,"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.","Am o iwawalam na rana ni Moyse am apyaha, ta abo marahet do dang. "
1238088,"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. ","Manngwa, iwawalam na ni Moyse o yangay ko do kararatan? Jyabo kakman na sang a. O yangay ko do kararatan am raraten ko. Abo o karatan no iwawalam na ni Moyse. Ta ipakateneng no tao do raraten na. So na ikanoyong no raraten a mapeyparai jyaten ji Ama ta do to."
1238089,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. ",Manoyong o na kapo ji Ama ta do to no iwawalam na ni Moyse. Am yaten rana am tao ta. Jyabo kapakataptap ta so yadomket a ciring do iwawalam na ni Moyse a. 
1238090,"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. ",Ko jyatenngi o ko vazay. Ta o ko ikakza a vazay am ko ji peyvazaya. O ko pacioyyan a vazay am ko mangay peyvazain. 
1238091,"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. ","Ko anoyngan o iwawalam na ni Moyse a manci nyaken a ji meyraraten. Am ko jyapakongo kataotao ko, ta ko meyraraten. "
1238092,"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. ",No yamanoyong ori am beken a yaken o yameyngongyod a yamapeyvazay sya. Ta o raraten do onowned ko am ori o yamapeyvazay sya. 
1238093,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh, ) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. ",Ko katenngan o na kabo no apya do onowned ko. Tana ko tey kakza ahapen o apya vazay am ko jyapakongo a yapeyvazain. 
1238094,"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. ",O ko ikakza apya vazay am ko ji ngapa. O ko jyakzan a marahet a vazay am ko ahapen. 
1238095,"Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. ",No si peyvazain ko o yako jyakzan a vazay am manoyong ka beken a yaken no nang. Ta vazay na ori no yamyan do onowned ko a raraten.
1238096,"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. ","Cinatao ko o kapeyraraten ko. No ko ikakza o yako kapanidong am ko ji peyvazaya, ko kahap so yamarahet a vazay. "
1238097,For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: ,Am o na ikakza no onowned ko am vazay na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238098,"but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. ",Am kapeylamlamsoy na so kataotao ko no raraten. Ori o yamaciliman do ikakza no onowned ko. Am ori o yako icyakmey mavaod no raraten.
1238099,O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? ,Yako tey mazikna so onowned. Sino makasidong jyaken a komaro do raraten kaji ko angayan do kararatan. 
1238100,I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.,Ko isaray ji Ama ta do to. Ta yana sidongen yaken ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. Yako ikakza o yako kownot ji Ama ta do to am o raraten do onowned ko am ori o yasomengseng jyaken.
1238101,"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. ",O pacikaopan ni Kizisto a tao sicyaikwaya am ji na rana meydednai no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to a mangay no makwa. 
1238102,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. ,Ta o Seyzi am ori o yamapanop jyaten ji Yeso Kizisto. So ta ikanoyong rana yakmey nikowvayan so raraten a kano ji na rana meydednai no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238103,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: ",O iwawalam na ni Moyse am ji na sidong yaten a komaro do peyraratenan ta. Ta cinatao ta o kapeyraraten ta. Am si Ama ta do to am ori o yanisomidong jyaten. Na nitovoy o Anak na a yamacingay so keyteytawan do tao do karawan a yanimawakwak no raraten ta. So ji na rana nalamozongi nyaten no raraten. 
1238104,"that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. ","O nikakman na sang ni Ama ta do to am na ikarilaw yaten a ji makataptap so iwawalam ni Moyse. Am ori o na nitovoyan so Seyzi a omoyat jyaten a omonot do isaray na ni Ama ta do to a vazay, a ji rana meyraratenan. "
1238105,For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. ,Ta o to mangozay do malas a onowned a tao am italamozong no onowned na. Omonot do Seyzi a tao am italamozong na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238106,For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. ,O italamozong no adan na onowned a tao am mangay do kararatan. O italamozong no Seyzi am mahap da o ikapiya no onowned da kano to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da. 
1238107,"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. ",O to mangozay do malas a onowned na tao am akma ney kavosoyan si Ama ta do to. Ta ji na ngonoci o iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238108,So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. ,O to mangozay do malas a onowned na tao am ji nakzan o akman sang ni Ama ta do to.
1238109,"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. ",No si italamozong na inyo no Seyzi am manoyong o kaji nyo na mangozayan do adan a onowned nyo. Ta o vazay no Seyzi o pangozayan nyo. O kabwan no Seyzi na ni Yeso Kizisto am ji macikaop ji Kizisto. 
1238110,"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. ","Am no si myan jinyo si Kizisto am tana mawakwak o kataotao nyo am mavyay o pahad nyo, ta yana rana nivonas o raraten nyo ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o na abnekan jinyo abo rana so raraten do tangain na. "
1238111,"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. ","No si myan jinyo o Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to a niomvyay si Yeso Kizisto am akman kamo sang a ipirwa na avyain ni Ama ta do to, do kowyat na jinyo no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to."
1238112,"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. ","Am ori an, manga kakteh o ji ta to mangozai do adan ta onowned an. "
1238113,"For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.",Ta no si to nyo mangozai o adan a onowned nyo am jyabo kaji nyo angayan do kararatan a. Am no si onotan nyo o Seyzi a komaro do raraten nyo am jyabo kaji nyo avyayan do teyngato a. 
1238114,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. ",O ipeypalanginan na no Seyzi a tao am mamimin sira akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to. 
1238115,"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. ","Ta o itoro na ni Ama ta do to a Seyzi am beken a mapeylamlamsoy jinyo a omanyanyahey jinyo, ta peyvaliwen na inyo a akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to. So oyatan na jyaten no Seyzi a tomawag ji Ama ta do to a manci no, ""Mo Ama."" "
1238116,"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: ",O Seyzi do onowned ta am ori o ipakateneng ta do mina kapeyvaliw na jyaten a akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to. 
1238117,"and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.",No manoyong o kakma tey anak ni Ama ta do to am manoyong keyyan no itoro na jyaten no makwa. So ikakman ta sang a macikasaray do Anak na si Yeso Kizisto. Ta yaten rana am no macyanod ta do alalaw na ni Kizisto am macikazway ta do azwazway na.
1238118,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. ,Ko naknakmen o alalaw ta sicyaikwaya am jyabo kapakataha na so yaomanam a azwazway ta no makwa. 
1238119,For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. ,O yamakakaday a na nyamamaog ni Ama ta do to am yada toda ji nalla o araraw no ipeytotwaw no azwazway na do omanoyong jya tao. 
1238120,"For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. ","Ta o yameykamadadayan a nyamamaog na ni Ama ta do to am nimablis o nyamaogan na sira do kanimacizanod da ji Adam a nioyyan na ni Ama ta do to. Am beken a monganay do nyamamaog na o akman sang, ta monganay ji Ama ta do to. Am tana akman sang am amyan so kasa araw a isaliway da no nyamamaog na.

So ikanoyong da rana macikasaray do omanoyong ji Ama ta do to a tao a ji rana babalinas. "
1238121,For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. ,"Yata katenngan sicyaikwaya o yamakakaday a yana nyamamaog ni Ama ta do to a yamyan so alalaw, akman so amyan do vahay a mavakes so zikzikna. "
1238122,"And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. ","Beken a o nyamamaog na o akman sang. Ta yaten rana ya na yanan no Seyzi a tao a yongkad na no kapanta na nyaten ni Ama ta do to so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta am akman ta sang do onowned ta a macizizikna jya, a omapanala si Ama ta do to a mapanop jyaten a anak na a manta nyaten so ji rana wakwak a kataotao ta do teyngato. "
1238123,"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? ",O na patazadangan jyaten ni Ama ta do to am ta toda ji ngamoga a yamahap o yana itoro ni Ama ta do to. Am no to na cita o akman sang am ji mancyan ori a yatoda ji ngamoga a mahap a itoro na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238124,"But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.",Am no ipeyhanhan ta o yaji macimatai am manoyong kaji ta maciziziknan a omnanala sya.
1238125,Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. ,"Akman sang, ta no myan so alalaw ta am na sidongen yaten no Seyzi. No ji ta teneng a mapasyasi ji Ama ta do to am na rana to mapasyasyan nyaten no Seyzi no ji ta tenngi a patwawen a ciring. "
1238126,"And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. ",Si Ama ta do to o yamakateneng do onowned ta. Katenngan na o nakenakem no Seyzi. Ta o Seyzi am na to mangozai o nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to a yameynozi nyaten a yamanoyong a italamozong na tao.
1238127,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. ",Tamo katenngan na kasidong ni Ama ta do to so yamraralay nya a tao a nipamnekan na mangozay do nakenakem na a tao. So na ikamimin no vazay da na ipeypalanginan ni Ama ta do to. So ikanoyong da meypapya nya. 
1238128,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. ",Ta o nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a amraralay nya tao am to na ji ngamoga sira akman so Anak na si Yeso Kizisto apiya so ahahapan sya. So ikanoyong na ni Yeso a akmey rakeh na jyaten akmey meyketeketeh do cinai. 
1238129,"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.","Ta o tao a nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a amraralay nya am nipanop na sira a omanoyong jya, kabnek na sira abo so raraten do tangain na. So ikanoyong da macikazway jya do teyngato no makwa."
1238130,"What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? ",No yakman sang am ikongo ipanci ta. No si sidongen na yaten ni Ama ta do to am abo makaharag jyaten. 
1238131,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? ",Kakwakwan no Anak na yana ji ingbeywani a yana nitoro a mawakwak nyaten. Ney manngo rana o yamakakaday a kakzeben ta no nakem. Ta jyabo o na ingbeywan jyaten a. 
1238132,Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. ,Sino o amraherahet jyaten a nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to. Ta yaten rana am na rana nibnek yaten a abo so raraten do tangain na. 
1238133,"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. ",Am sino paro o yamanci no kaoya na nyaten ni Ama ta do to no makwa. Jyabo asa ka tao a. Ta si Yeso Kizisto rana nimawakwak a kapirwa na mavyay am yamyan rana do wanan na ni Ama ta do to a yameyneynozi nyaten. 
1238134,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? ","Ikongo o makapasyay jyaten do pangangarilawan ni Yeso Kizisto. Manngwa, alalaw ta? Manngwa, peyrarehtan da jyaten? Manngwa, kakcinan ta? Manngwa, kabo no peymeymasaodan ta? Manngwa, kangineynanawan ta? Manngwa, wakwakan da jyaten? Jyabo a. Ta yabo o makapasyay jyaten do pangangarilawan ni Ama ta do to. "
1238135,"As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.","O aro a alalaw ta am akman so yadomket do Seysyo. Ta maniring am, ""Anoyngan namen imo. Am ori o yanamen ipangday so araraw a yatoda jyangay so inawan. Yada yamen patpehen no tao do kagling a yaomanam a yada wakwaken."""
1238136,"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. ","Am cyaha, ta no si ipeyhanhan ta si Yeso Kizisto a yamarilaw nyaten am jyabo kaji ta makaharagan so yamakakaday a alalaw ta a. "
1238137,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.","Ta yako anoyngan o kabo no makapasyay jyaten do pangangarilawan ni Ama ta do to.

1238138,"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. ","Manga kakteh, ko tey kakza sira o Isedi a tao a kasina ko no inawan a ahapen na ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o ko jimtaji nira a ipeynozi ji Ama ta do to. "
1238139,"For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. ",To ko na macitangain jinyo am yamanoyong da kakdeng no nakem ji Ama ta do to. Am yaji macimangno o da katenngan. 
1238140,"For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. ",Da to mangozangozai o nakenakem da a mahap so iwawalam na ni Moyse a yaji meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to a yamvonas so raraten a manci nira abo rana so raraten do tangain na. 
1238141,For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. ,O na nyai ni Kizisto do karawan am ipanci na o kabo no oyowyat no iwawalam na ni Moyse a amvonas so raraten no tao. Ta si Ama ta do to o makavonas so raraten ta tao. So ikanoyong no meyhanhan rana nya tao a abneken na ni Ama ta do to a abo rana so raraten do tangain na.
1238142,"For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. ",O nipanci ni Moyse am o tao a makataptap sya ahapen so nivatvatkan na a iwawalam am ori o abneken na ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na.
1238143,"But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) ","Am o meyhanhan ni Yeso a tao o vonasen na ni Ama ta do to so raraten a abneken na abo so raraten do tangain na. Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Ji mo mancyan o, 'Sino mangay do teyngato a mapeyhekas si Kizisto.'"""
1238144,"or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) ","""Ji mo mancyan o, 'Sino mangay a mapeyvangon si Kizisto do heseb na.'"""
1238145,"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; ","Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Jyabo kasalit no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a katenngan nyo a.

1238146,"that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. ",No si to mo na mancyan kanoyong mo ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen mo a kanoyong mo jya a nipirwa na avyain ni Ama ta do to am ahapen na imo ni Ama ta do to. 
1238147,For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. ,"Ta no anoyngan ta si Yeso am abneken na yaten ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na. Akman sang, ta no to ta na patwawa do tao o kanoyong ta ji Kizisto am manoyong o kahap na rana jyaten ni Ama ta do to. "
1238148,"For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. ","Maniring do Seysyo am, ""Omanoyong jya tao am amyan so nakem na jira ni Ama ta do to."""
1238149,For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. ,"O peycirngan na so sang am kazagoman ta tao a meyhanhan nya.

1238150,For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. ,"Akman so ciring do Seysyo. Maniring am, ""O tomawag jya tao am patazadangen na sira."""
1238151,How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? ,Am no ji da nganoyngi am makongo sira tomawag jya.

1238153,"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? ","Am beken a todamimin o tao a omanoyong do Mapasaray a Ciriciring na. Maniring si Isayya am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, sino omanoyong do yanamen ipeylimwang a ciriciring mo."""
1238154,"So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. ",So ikanoyong no kayapo na do kapakamizing so ciriciring na ni Kizisto o peyhanhanan ta nya.

1238159,"I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

1238160,"God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, ","Na jya nitaosya ni Ama ta do to o nipamnekan na pa tao no kakwa.

1238162,"But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.

1238163,"Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. ",Yakman sang sicyaikwaya do Isedi a tao. Ta yana nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to sira o yapereh a tao.

1238218,"for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.

1238237,"For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. ",Ta si Yeso Kizisto rana am nimawakwak a keypirwa na rana mavyay. O ikakman na sang am peypanirsirngan da no mavyay a tao a kano nimawakwak a tao.
1238238,But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. ,Am sino ka paro amraherahet so akma moy kakteh do cinai.

1238245,"for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

1238248,For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. ,Ji nyo peyparaheta no isovo nyo a kanen o vazay na ni Ama ta do to do onowned no akma nyoy kakteh do cinai.

1238249,"It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. ","Apyapya pa o kajyanganan so vinyay, ji ngyop so saki a ji mapeyvazay so makakaday a vazay a pacikzan da meyraraten no akma tey kakteh do cinai. "
1238250,Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. ,Ta ipeyhanhan mo o vazay mo do tangain na ni Ama ta do to abo so karatan. So ji mo meykawaji so nakenakem.

1238315,even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: ,O ciring na rana ni Kizisto a nipeylimwang ko jinyo am yamanoyong a yana amyan do onowned nyo. 
1238316,so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: ,"So yana ikabo no yana jya nitoro jinyo no Seyzi a oyowyat a kano teneteneng nyo, do nyo kapanala si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta a mai. "
1238317,"who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. ","Jyabo kaji na ngoyatan jinyo ni Yeso a. So ikanoyong nyo na abo rana so karatan do tangain na, no si mai si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. "
1238318,"God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.",Abo kalalasan na ni Ama ta do to a nimamnek jinyo a meyhanhan nya. So ikanoyong nyo rana macikaop do Anak na si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta.
1238319,"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. ","Manga kakteh, ko vavagan inyo no ngaran ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta akmey asa so ciriciring a ji meykataretarek so nakenakem a malwalovot, akmey asa so onowned, akmey asa so pangozayan. "
1238320,"For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. ",Ta o kararay na ni Kelay a tao am sya jya nimanayotayo so ciring da jyaken. Maniring sira jyaken am yamyan kono jinyo do dang so nyo ipeykataretarek so nakenakem.

Yamyan so yamanci no na kapacyanod ji Kizisto. 
1238322,Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? ,"So yanyo icyakmey amvonong so kataotao na ni Yeso Kizisto. Manngwa, yaken o nimawakwak ninyo do jyojika an? Manngwa, yada inyo nitaktakan no ngaran ko an? "
1238323,"I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; ",Ko isaray ji Ama ta do to an. Ta si Kedisepo a kani Cyayo o nitaktakan ko. So na ikabo no ikararwa na nira ori a nitaktakan ko. 
1238324,lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. ,So ikabo na jinyo no manci no kanitomaktak ko jinyo no ngaran ko. 
1238325,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. ",Si Setiva rana asa ka vahay o ko nikahamangan a nitaktakan. So ko na ji makatenngi do na keyyan pa no nitaktakan ko jinyo do dang. 
1238326,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.","Ta o nipamnekan na jyaken ni Kizisto am beken a manaktak. Ta kapeylimwang ko no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. So ji ko mangozai do teneteneng ko a mangononong. Ta si akman sang am o teneteneng ko a mangononong o ikakza da ahapen no tao, a kaji da na ngapan so oyowyat no mina kawakwak na ni Kizisto do jyojika."
1238327,For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. ,O ipeylimwang a jyojika ni Yeso Kizisto am abo o peypeypangayan na do ji manganoyong a tao. Am yaten a na patazadangen do teyngato ni Ama ta do to am tey rako ori a oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to.

1238329,Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?,No akman sang am wanjin o teneteneng da no mateneng a tao. Wanjin o teneng da no aro so nivilangan a tao. Wanjin sira o makey a macinekanekad a tao do karawan. So na nipeyolyan sya ni Ama ta do to so teneteneng no tao do karawan abo so angangayan.
1238330,"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. ",Tey makdeng o teneteneng na ni Ama ta do to. So ikabo no tao do karawan a mangozay do teneteneng da makateneng ji Ama ta do to.

1238331,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: ",Kakdain da no tao do Yotay o kapakacita da so mapeyzokab a vazay. Ta ori o yanoyong da ji Ama ta do to. Kakdain da no tao do Sila o kateneng da. Ta ipeyhanhan da o teneteneng no tao do karawan. 
1238332,"but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; ",Am yanamen ipeylimwang si Kizisto a nipadket da do jyojika. O akman rana sang do tao do Yotay am ipacimanig da. Am no citahen da o akman sang no beken a tao do Yotay am abwata o ayyaingan na. 
1238333,"but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. ",Am do tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay a nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a omanoyong ji Kizisto am katenngan da si Kizisto a yanan no rako a oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to a kano teneteneng na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238334,Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.,Ta o todalapit a teneng ni Ama ta do to am maharahara pa kano teneteneng no tao. O alikey a oyowyat ni Ama ta do to am rakorako pa kano rako a oyowyat no tao.
1238335,"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: ","Manga kakteh, naknakmen nyo an. Ta akman kamo so wanjin a tao no kapamnek na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. No ahapen ta do tao am apereh jinyo o mateteneng a kano meynakem a tao. "
1238336,but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; ,"Am nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to o ipangoyongoyod da a jyateteneng a tao do karawan, mangay na ipeyleylak so mapahama so nakem a tao do karawan. "
1238337,"and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: ",Na nipamnekan o ji da pavivilanga a tao do karawan a kano ikaoya da kano ipanci da abwata so pacicingayan a ipaveveh na so ipanci da meynakem a tao do karawan. 
1238338,that no flesh should glory in his presence. ,Ta ori o ikabo no tao a mapazway do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238339,"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: ",Am si Ama ta do to o yanimapanop jinyo ji Yeso Kizisto.

1238341,"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. ",No kangay ko pa jinyo no kakwa pa am ji ko nipatwaw o makdeng a ciriciring ko jinyo a kano teneteneng ko a inanao ko jinyo no kapeylimwang ko no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to jinyo. 
1238342,"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. ",Ta mina to ko na mamneki do kabo no yamatarek a yako inanao jinyo. Ta si Yeso Kizisto a nipadket da do jyojika o yako inanao jinyo. 
1238343,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. ","Am ori an, makaranes ko jinyo do dang am malma ko so kataotao amzikzik do kanyahey ko. Ta ihawa ko kaji ko makatenngan do vazay na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238344,"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: ",O nipeylimwang ko a ciriciring am beken a masalit a amizngen. So ko ji meyhanhani no ciring ko. Ta yako ipeyhanhan o Seyzi a omoyat jyaken a mapatwaw sya. 
1238345,"that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.",So ikanoyong no nakenakem nyo ji Ama ta do to. Beken a monganay do teneteneng no tao. Ta monganay do oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to.
1238346,"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: ",Am o yamakekdeng so nakem ji Ama ta do to am yako peylimwangan no yamakdeng a nanao. Am beken a monganay do tao do karawan o teneteneng. So ji ko makalavaci so teneteneng no panirsirngen do karawan. Ta amyan so kasaraw a kabo na no teneteneng da. 
1238347,"but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: ",O yako ipeylimwang eya am ji da pa nipatwaw no tao no kakwa a teneteneng na ni Ama ta do to. Ta no kaji na pa mamaogan no karawan am amyan rana ori a nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to do kapacikaop ta jya no makwa. 
1238348,"which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. ",O panipanirsirngen do karawan am abo jira o manoyong a makateneng do pamnemnekan na ni Ama ta do to. No nikatenngan da am jyabo kato da padketan so mazway a Panirsirngen ta do jyojika. 
1238349,"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, Neither have entered into the heart of man, The things which God hath prepared for them that love him.","Akman so ciring do Seysyo. Ta maniring am, ""O nakem na ni Ama ta do to a itoro na do amraralay nya tao am ji da pa nimacita no mata da. Ji da pa nimamizing no cicilwan da. Ji da pa nimanakem no tao."""
1238350,"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. ",Am na kasidong jyaten no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to a ta ipakateneng jya. Ta katenngan no Seyzi o makakaday a vazay. Katenngan na o jyatenngi a vazay na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238351,"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. ","Ji ta tenngi o nakenakem da no tao, ta o kataotao da o makateneng jya. Akman sang an, ta o Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to o makateneng do makakaday a vazay na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238352,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. ",Tanyo jya nyahap o teneteneng da no tao do karawan. Ta o nitovoy na ni Ama ta do to a Seyzi am ori o ta nyahap. Ori o ta ipakateneng do makakaday a aryarilaw na jyaten ni Ama ta do to.
1238353,"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. ","Ori an, ikabeken a teneteneng no tao o namen inanao jinyo a ciriciring. Ta ciriciring no Seyzi o namen ninanao jinyo a na yanan rana no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238354,"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. ",O kabwan no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to am ji na hap o itoro no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to. Ta o akman rana sang a tao am ji da tenngi o akman sang a vazay. Ta ipanci da abo so angangayan. Ta o yanan no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to o makateneng jya. 
1238355,"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. ",O yanan no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to a tao am ori o makateneng do monganay ji Ama ta do to a vazay. Am o kabwan no Seyzi a tao am ji da tenngi o monganay ji Ama ta do to a vazay. Am ori o ji da zyaki no akman sang a tao. 
1238356,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.","Akman so ciring do Seysyo. Maniring am, ""Sino makateneng do onowned na ni Ama ta do to. Sino makayokod nya."" Am yaten takamo a yana yanan no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to am katenngan ta o onowned na ni Kizisto."
1238357,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. ","Manga kakteh, ji ko na naywa jinyo o ciring ko. No kananao ko pa jinyo no kakwa am ji ko meyhanhanan inyo a ipeypalanginan na no Seyzi. Ta monganay kamo pa do karawan. So nyo icyakmey kanakan pa so nakenakem a yaji meypahagnat a yamraralay ni Kizisto. "
1238358,"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.","Ori o ko peyyopan pa jinyo no meyzoko, ta marahet pa o kapakan ko jinyo no cinvevekeh. Ta ji nyo anget. So nyo ikakman sang sicyaikwaya a yaji ngahap so yamakdeng a yako inanao jinyo. "
1238359,"For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? ",Ta inyo rana am nyo pa pangozayan o icicirawat no tao. Ta amyan pa jinyo so yamanginanahet a kano yamgalagal a tao. O na ikakman sang am kakownongan na no nyo kapacikaop pa do karawan. 
1238360,"For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? ","Yamyan so yatatasa jinyo a yamanci no, ""Yaken am yako macyanod ji Pawlo."" Yamyan so tao a yamanci no, ""Yaken am ko macyanod ji Apolo."" So nyo ipeyyangay pa kano yaji nganoyong ji Yeso a tao."
1238361,"Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? ",Ikongo angangayan ni Apolo a ka nyaken. Yamen rana am na kapeylamlamsoy jyamen ni Ama ta do to a yamapalolo jinyo a yaomanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto. Ta namen to mangozai o nitoro na ni Ama ta do to a vazay. 
1238362,"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. ",Ko nimowa a na kataktak jya ni Apolo. O amzowazovo sya am si Ama ta do to. 
1238363,"So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. ",O mapamowa sya kano tomaktak jya am todalapit pa ori a vazay. Am o amzowazovo sya am si Ama ta do to. 
1238364,Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. ,O mapamowa sya kano tomaktak jya am meyyangay a lamlamsoy na ni Ama ta do to. So to na palololoi sya ni Ama ta do to do lamlamsoy na so itoro na jira. 
1238365,"For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.",Yamen rana am namen macipeyvazay ji Ama ta do to. Inyo rana am kanyo akmey nihakawan na ni Ama ta do to a namen pirwahen pa. So nyo icyakmey vahay a na patneken ni Ama ta do to.
1238366,"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. ","No ko pangozayan o nitoro na jyaken ni Ama ta do to a teneteneng am ko akmey mateneng a mangamaog so vahay a tao, do kanimapangay ko so soil na a katonton da jya pakapyahen do teyngato no karwan no tao. So pakapyan da so paringen da vahay. "
1238367,"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. ",Ta abo ikararwa na ni Yeso Kizisto a nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a akma ney soil. 
1238368,"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; ",O mangamaog so vahay a tao am amyan so mangamaog no vowawan. Amyan so mangamaog no lalitan. So iyan no tao a mamaring no kayo a kano vocid. 
1238369,"every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. ",Am o mina vazay ta am macita ta rana no makwa o kehni na a kaji nehniyan. Ta no marateng rana o araraw na no yai ni Yeso am patwawen na rana. Ori o ipakateneng rana jya. Ta no makwa am askadan na rana ni Yeso o mina vazay ta. 
1238370,"If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. ",O mehni so niparing a tao am ori o mavezed. O akman rana sang a tao am ori azawen na. 
1238371,"If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.","Am o jyehni so niparing am abo azaw na. Am ahapen na ni Ama ta do to do teyngato, do kakma ney nimakagag so kataotao na do apoy."
1238372,"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? ","Manngwa, nyo jyatenngi o na kapacilovot jinyo ni Ama ta do to? Manngwa, nyo jyatenngi na keyyan jinyo no Seyzi? "
1238373,"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.","Am ori an, no si amyan so tao a mapeykaraherahet so kataotao na a na pacikaopan ni Ama ta do to am jyabo kaji na patovilan jya. Ta o pacikaopan ni Ama ta do to a tao am abo karatan na. Inyo rana am yamyan jinyo si Ama ta do to."
1238374,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. ",Ji nyo ngalalasa o aktokto no kataotao nyo an. No amyan jinyo so ominara so icicirawat no tao do karawan a mapazway so teneng na am iptad na rana o kapakateneteneng na. Ta ori o ikanoyong na mateneng a tao. 
1238375,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. ","Ta o ipanci no tao do karawan a mateneng am ipanci na ni Ama ta do to a jyateneng a tao. Akman so ciring do Seysyo. Maniring am, ""O mateneng a tao am kalittan sira no teneng da kaji na mangononongan no vazay da."""
1238376,"And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. ","O ciring pa do Seysyo am, ""Katenngan na ni Ama ta do to o kabo no peypeypangayan na no naknakmen da no mapakateneteneng a tao."""
1238377,Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's; ,Am ori o ikabo no tao a mapazway a manci no kownot na do kadwan jyamen. Ta yamen rana a yamangnanao am nitovoy na yamen jinyo ni Ama ta do to a amnanao jinyo. 
1238378,"whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's; ",Yamen rana si Apolo a kani Pite am namen meyyangangay a nitovoy na ni Ama ta do to a somidong jinyo. Tana karawan a tana mavyay kano mawakwak a tana sicyaikwaya kano makwa am o yamakakaday rana ya am nitoro na ni Ama ta do to a ipeypapya nyo. 
1238379,and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.,"Am naknakmen nyo an, ta inyo am na italamozong ni Kizisto an. Si Kizisto am amizngen na si Ama ta do to."
1238380,"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. ",Inyo rana am panadnaden nyo yamen a lamlamsoy na ni Kizisto a nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a meylimwang no ciriciring na an. Ori rana am ji da tenngi no tao no kakwa. 
1238381,"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. ",O kakzeben no lawpan do lamlamsoy na am manoyong so onowned. 
1238382,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. ","Yaken rana am tana pacicin nyo yaken am tana pacicin da yaken no mapacicici so tao am to ko pa nazibwan o akman sang a vazay. Ta ji ko mancyan kapya na, karahet na no vazay ko. "
1238383,For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. ,Yako jyatenngi o keyyan no ko karatan. Am yako ji mancyan o kabo na. Ta si Ama ta do to o manoyong a makateneng jya. 
1238384,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.","Am ori an, ji nyo manamwaji so tao do ji na pa makaranesi no yai ni Kizisto.

No marateng rana ori am mamimin o tao a makahap so itoro na jira ni Ama ta do to a sarasaray da. Am palololwen na do mina vazay da."
1238385,"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. ","Manga kakteh, o ko pancyan no aro a vazay namen si Apolo am ipakateneng nyo do kaji nyo mapeycyakabanan so lamlamsoy na ni Ama ta do to akman so domket do Seysyo a ciring. "
1238386,"For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? ","Inyo rana mapakazwazway am sino ney mowyat na jinyo a makaharag so tao. Manngwa, nyo jyatenngi o yamakakaday jinyo a yamamimin a yapo ji Ama ta do to? Ikongo nyo peyzezwayan no nitoro na jinyo. Am ori o pavevehan nyo pa so nakenakem nyo an."
1238387,"Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. ","Ala nyo ipanci o kabwata rana no yaji ngyangyan jinyo, a yarana makataptap so teneteneng a kano makakaday a itoro na jinyo ni Ama ta do to a akmey amyan rana do panirsirngen. Inaoy no si manoyong keyyan nyo do peypakarangan nyo a kapacikazway namen jinyo a panirsirngen. "
1238388,"For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. ",Ta no ko citahen am yamen rana nipamnekan na ni Yeso a amlivolivon no ciriciring na am yakmey nipazasing na yamen ni Ama ta do to do pakananaken a tao do karawan. Akman so nipamnekan da rana wakwaken a meyraraten a tao a ipeyyangwangongoyod da no tao do karawan a kano tinsi. 
1238389,"We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. ","Da ipanci yamen no tao do karawan a abo so kapsepsekan, do namen kapangnanao no ciriciring na ni Kizisto. Am inyo am nyo ipanci o kataotao nyo a mateneng a meyhanhan ni Kizisto. So nyo ikowyowyat pa ka nyamen. So da kolalahan jyamen a da kanig ninyo. "
1238390,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; ","Yato ngai sicyaikwaya o yanamen ipacikekcin a yamawaw a yamamez a abo so ayob a yamasangib a yada bakbakan a yabo so vahay, "
1238391,"and labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: ",a yamowyat a yameyvazay a yamyaw no velek namen. So yanamen ikasangib a yada avain. Am namen ipeynozi sira. No yada peymetdehan yamen am namen to nazibwan. 
1238392,"being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.","No yada yamen pasnesneken am namen tovisan sira no apya a ciriciring. Na kai sicyaikwaya no yada pancyan nyamen a akmey ibeybek no karawan, abo so angangayan a tao."
1238393,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you. ","O yako vatvatkan do yakman sang a ciriciring am beken a ko ipasnesnek jinyo, ta yako ipeypakatkat jinyo akma koy anak. "
1238394,"For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. ",Tana todaro tao amnanao jinyo a mapeypahagnat so nakenakem nyo ji Kizisto am asa saon o ama nyo am. Ta yaken rana am nipeylimwang ko jinyo o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. So yako icyakmey ama nyo a omanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto. 
1238395,"Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. ",Am ori o ko vavagan jinyo a ominara jyaken. 
1238396,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.","So tovoyan ko si Timotay a mangay jinyo do dang.

Ori rana am nipangnanao ko rana ori do peycyakyokyokayan na."
1238397,"Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. ",Yamyan so yatatasa ka tao jinyo a yamapahama so nakem a yamanci no kaji ko rana nangayan jinyo do dang. 
1238398,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. ",Am no si apyahen na yaken ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta am jyabo kapeyyahahay ko a mangay a tomita jinyo a. No si marateng rana o araraw no yangay ko jinyo do dang am jyabo kaji ko ankadan do vazay da kano ciring da no mapakazwazway a tao. 
1238399,"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. ",Ta o tao rana a macikaop do italamozong na ni Ama ta do to am to rana cita do vazay da o oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to. So ji na makaneci no ciriciring da. 
1238400,"What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?","Ikongo apyahen nyo a vazay ko si makaranes ko jinyo do dang. Manngwa, apyahen nyo o kaoya ko ninyo? No apyapyahen nyo o kasaray ko ninyo."
1238401,"It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. ",Yamanoyong o kanimakamizing ko so keyyan na jinyo no mapasagpyan so kataotao na. O akman rana sang a vazay am ji da mya no ji manaralay a tao. O nimamizing ko am amyan so tao a mapasagpyan so nakenakem na do kaminan na. 
1238402,"And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you. ","Ikongo dang o pazwain nyo. Manngwa, ji nyo a ratan so onowned o akman so sang so vazay a tao? Am ori o to nyo na pasyai so akman sang a tao. "
1238403,"For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, ","Yaken rana am tana yamarai o kataotao ko jinyo am onowned ko am yakmey to ngyan jinyo.

1238404,"to deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. ",O akman rana sang a tao am to nyo macyozai a kapeyingnen na so kataotao na ni Satan. Si maliliw na o kataotao na meyngen am ori o ipamlis na rana a kavyay no pahad na no si pirwa mai si Yeso a Panirsirngen ta.
1238405,Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? ,"Taosya o kapakazwazway nyo. Nyo jyatenngi o ciring a manci no, ""O likta kosozi no odong am mapeymway na o rako a odong."" "
1238406,"Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: ","So pakarwan nyo so kosozi no odong a mapeyraraten jinyo, ta ori o ikanownaw no onowned nyo a nimavonas rana so raraten. Ta nimawakwak si Yeso Kizisto a yanimalit so raraten ta, akmey kagling a wakwaken da no tao do Yotay. So nipatastasan na sira no tinsi a jya nimwakwak so kabnekan da no yanan no rala no kagling a vahay. "
1238407,"therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.","Ori an, sarayan ta ni Yeso a nimawakwak no raraten ta.

Ta o manownaw a onowned a kano manoyong a nanao o ahapen ta, akman so kabwan no kosozi a odong."
1238408,I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: ,O mina teygami ko jinyo no kakwa am nipaziman ko na jinyo o kaji nyo macihzan do mapasagpyan so nakenakem a tao. 
1238409,"yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. ","O ko ipanci am beken a ji manaralay a tao a somagpyan, mangamkam, manakaw a kano manaralay so malas a iraralay. Ta no si karwan ta na o karawan saon o ji ta macikaopi jira. "
1238410,"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. ","O peypeypangayan no ciring ko am ji macihza do mapasagpyan so nakenakem na, mangamkam, manaralay so malas a iraralay, mangangavain, masakisakin a kano manakaw a ji mamlis so nakenakem a sinjya.

1238411,For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.,"Ji ta zyakan sira o ji manaralay a tao, ta si Ama ta do to o mapacici sira.

1238415,"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. ","No akman sang a keyyan no ikazyak nyo am manngwa, ipanci nyo sira o ji manaralay a tao a mangay omzavat sya? "
1238416,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? ","Tey macimasnek o akman sang. Manngwa, yabwata rana jinyo o yasa ka mapatak a tao a mangay omzavat so ikazyak da no akma tey kakteh do cinai? "

1238428,But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. ,Am o macikaop ji Yeso am macilovot o nakenakem na ji Yeso an.
1238429,Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. ,Am ori o ji nyo pasagpyani so kataotao nyo an.

1238433,"Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. ",Am yana katey yaro no vazay da yamapasagpyan so kataotao da. Am ori o ikapyapya na rana no kapazagpit da no mahakay. Akman sira so sang o mavakes a macivahavahay. 
1238434,Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. ,O mahakay am panadnaden na o kahanghangan na. Akman sang o mavakes na. 
1238435,"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. ","Ta o kataotao no mavakes am italamozong no mahakay na. Akman sang o kataotao na no mahakay na, ta italamozong na no mavakes na. "
1238436,"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. ",Am ori o ji nyo mapasalai do kadwan jinyo an. No nakem no asa jinyo so kapeynozi na am manoyong o kapeytarek nyo so alikey. Am no komavos rana a meynozi am meytovong kamo na meyyaven do vahay.

1238440,"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. ",Am no si ji nyo apzaci o onowned nyo am apyapya o kapazagzagpit nyo. Ta maraherahet o kato na ngyanan do onowned nyo no kakey nyo a macivahavahay.
1238441,"And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: ","So iyan no ciring ko do nimeysinmo rana tao. Ta beken a nakenakem ko ya, ta nakenakem na ni Yeso. O mavakes rana am ji na ngaroi o kahanghangan na mahakay. "
1238442,"but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife. ","No manoyong kanikomaro na rana am ji rana macivahavahay no ji rana meyoli do kahanghangan na. So icyakman na sang no mahakay, ta ji na to pakarwa o kahanghangan na mavakes."
1238443,"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. ","Akman sang, ta yamyan so ciring ko do karwan no tao. Am beken a nakenakem na ni Yeso.

1238444,"And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. ",No myan so manaralay a mavakes a nisomeksek rana do ji manaralay a mahakay a kasaray na no mahakay a macitovong jya am ji na to ngaroi o mahakay na. 
1238445,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. ",Ta o ji manaralay a mahakay a nimapazagpit rana so manaralay a mavakes am masidong na no mavakes na. So ipacyangay na do mavakes na masidong na ni Ama ta do to.

So ikanoyong da peypapyahen na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238446,"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace. ","Am no karwan da sira o manaralay a kadwan da do vahay am to nyo na macyozai o akman sang. Tana mahakay a tana mavakes am ji nyo na ratan, ta o nipamnekan na jyaten ni Ama ta do to am kakzeben na yaten apiya so nakenakem do kavavahay ta. "
1238447,"For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?",Ta imo rana a yamanaralay a mavakes am ikongo mo ipakateneng do kapakasidong mo so kahanghangan mo a omanoyong ji Yeso. Inyo rana kamahakayan a yamanaralay am ikongo nyo ipakateneng do kapakasidong nyo so kamavakesan nyo a omanoyong ji Yeso.
1238448,"But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches. ",Mamimin ta mangozay do nitoro na ni Ama ta do to a ahapan so kataotao ta an. So ji ta mapasalai jya. Ta ori o yako ipangnanao do peycyakyokyokayan na. 
1238449,Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. ,"Inyo rana tao do Yotay a niyongkadan rana do kataotao a manoyong a Isedi a tao a yamraralay rana ni Yeso am cyaha, ji nyo naywa o yongkad nyo. Am inyo rana beken a tao do Yotay a omanoyong rana ji Yeso am tana abo yongkad do kataotao nyo am abneken na inyo a anak na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238450,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. ",Tana niyongkadan a tana jya niyongkadan am meyyangay. O ney makdeng na am kownot ta ji Ama ta do to. 
1238451,Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. ,So ji ta ngezsangi no kasasaodan ta tao. 
1238452,"Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather. ",Tana nimeycicinda ka kalamsoyan da no tao no kapanaralay mo am ji mo a ratan. Akman ka sang so nakem no si ji da rana peylamlamsoya imo. 
1238453,"For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant. ","Ta o lamlamsoy da tao a omanoyong ji Yeso am to naliway rana sira do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. Akman so sang sira o to naliway a tao a omanoyong ji Yeso, ta lamlamsoy na sira ni Yeso Kizisto. "
1238454,Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. ,Inyo rana am yatey rako na nipalitan jinyo ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o ji nyo mamyapyai no tao a tomalamozong ninyo. Ta italamozong na rana inyo ni Ama ta do to. 
1238455,"Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.","Manga kakteh, ji nyo ngezsangan o kasasaodan nyo do tangain na ni Ama ta do to."
1238456,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.",Omagaz rana do ji pa nimacivahavahay a tao am abo nimahap ko a nakenakem na ni Yeso Kizisto. Am kanimarilaw na nyaken ni Ama ta do to a meyhanhan nya. So ko pangozayan do kataotao ko a yamapatwaw so ciring ko. 
1238457,"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be. ",No ko citahen o alalaw do teyrahem am ko apyapyahen pa kakman ta sya tao a ji macivahavahay. 
1238458,Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. ,No yarana myan jinyo so tao am ji nyo naknakma o kapakaro nyo sya. Am no si abo pa jimo tao am ji mo naknakma keyyan na jimo no tao. 
1238459,"But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you. ","Am no si ikakza mo o kapazagpit mo am cyaha, ta beken a raraten ori. Am ko apyapyahen pa kaji nyo nginaran sira masanga no meykamadadayan a vazay da do kavavahay da."
1238460,"But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none; ","O ko ipanci pa jinyo, manga kakteh am yalikey rana ta yahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to. Am ori an, inyo rana yamyan so kahanghangan a mavakes am akman kamo rana so kabwan no tao a abo rana so ikasanga a mahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238461,"and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; ","Tana meyngen o onowned a tana masaray, tana aro so apzapzatan a tana abo am taosya o kasanga na jinyo no makakaday a vazay a omraralay ni Ama ta do to. "
1238462,"and they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away. ",O nimakataptap rana so kanekanen do karawan am akman sira so ji nitomaham do kanekanen. Ta o karawan eya am makeykai a komavos.
1238463,"But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: ",Ji kamo a rahet so onowned. Ta o mahakay a kabwan no tao am to nangdengi o kanakenakem na so vazay na ni Ama ta do to a ipasaray na sya. 
1238464,"but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. ",O manakem da no mahakay a yanan rana no tao am naknakmen da o kapasaray da so mavakes da. 
1238465,"There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. ",So ikanoyong da meykarwa rana so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to. O ji nimacivahavahay pa a mavakes am vazay na ni Ama ta do to o manakem da. Ta isaray da kapeykingking da no oyowyat da kano onowned da. O manakem da no nimacivahavahay rana a mavakes am vazay do kavavahay da. Ta naknakmen da o kapasaray da so mahakay da.
1238466,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.",O ko peycirngan sang am ko sidongen inyo. So ko ji mapasonsoni jinyo. Ta ori o ikakdekdeng nyo pa mahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to a ji mangbeywan jya.
1238467,"But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. ",O nitamtamkan da rana tao a kaji da na ngapan sira am no ji na apzaci no mahakay o onowned na makza no kapapapen na pa am apyapya rana kato na rana mapapenan so yanan na so nakem a mavakes. Ta o akman rana sang am beken a raraten o akman sang. 
1238468,"Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. ",Am no myan so tao a jyakza no kapapapen na am to na rana mamneki do onowned na o kapzat na do onowned na. So ikapyapya na rana no kaji na mapapenan. 
1238469,So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.,Tana ipanci da o kapya no mapapapen am arakorako pa o kapyapya na no kaji mapapenan.
1238470,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. ",O nimacivahavahay rana mavakes am ji neksek do tao do iyan na pa no kahanghangan na do karawan. Am no mawakwak rana o mahakay na am apya o kapirwa na pa so kapacivahavahay na. Am ney yapiya na kangay na someksek do manaralay a tao. 
1238471,"But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.",Am no ji na ranakzan o kapacivahavahay na am apyapya rana o akman sang. Ori rana am nakenakem ko ori do kataotao ko. Am ko naknakmen o katalamozong na nyaken no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to.
1238472,"Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. ",O nipazos da kanen am tamo mamimin a makateneng do akman sang. O teneteneng rana ya am yapwan no kapazway no tao. Am o pangarilawan am ipeypapya so tao. 
1238473,"And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. ",O mapakateneteneng a tao am jyanoyong o katenngan na. 
1238474,"But if any man love God, the same is known of him. ",Am o amraralay ni Ama ta do to a tao am ori o ipanci na ni Ama ta do to a anak na.
1238475,"As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one. ",Oya rana o ipanci ko jinyo a omagaz do nipazos da kanen. Tanyo katenngan o kaji da anoyngan no malas a iraralay da. So tanyo ipakateneng do na kasa ni Ama ta do to a ta iraralay. 
1238476,"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many, ) ","Tana aro o malas a iraralay da kano ipanci da tomalamozong no hanit a kano teyrahem a iraralay da am, "
1238477,"but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. ","yaten rana a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to am yasa si Ama ta do to a na yapwan no meycyamadadayan. So yana ikanoyong a tomalamozong nyaten. Akman sang, ta abo ikararwa na ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta a nimangamamaog so meycyamadadayan a yana yapwan no ikavyay no pahad ta."
1238478,Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. ,Am yamyan pa so akma tey kakteh do cinai a yaji makateneng pa do kabo na no oyowyat no malas a iraralay da no karwan no tao. Ta yamangday da kakan so nipazos o da kapanci no da kapacizanod jira do amraralay no malas a iraralay da. Am ori o da karehtan nya so onowned no yakoman sira so yada nipazos. 
1238479,"But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. ",O kanen rana ya am ji na novili ni Ama ta do to. Tana koman ta do nipazos da am tana ji ta ngan am jyablis o nakenakem na jyaten ni Ama ta do to.
1238480,But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. ,Am azimanen nyo. Ta ji nyo akwan kapya na jinyo o kato nyo mangozayan do kataotao nyo. Ta panadnaden nyo sira o malma pa so onowned a amrahet pa sya. 
1238481,"For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; ",No myan pa so tao a marahet pa nya kapakacita na jinyo a makateneng jya tao a makapya koman so nipazos do panaralayan so malas a iraralay da am jyabo kaji nyo akmey to ngingitan sira koman so nipazos a. 
1238482,"and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? ",O malma pa so onowned a akma tey kakteh do cinai a nikawakwak ni Kizisto am jyabo kaji na ratan so kangangay a makacita jinyo a. 
1238483,"But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. ",O akman rana sang a vazay nyo am manoyong kanimeyraraten nyo do akma nyoy kakteh do cinai. So yanyo icyakmey amhaha so nakenakem da no yamalma pa so onowned a tao. So nyo ikanoyong a yameyraraten do tangain na ni Kizisto. 
1238484,"Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.",Am ori o no si ikarahet da o kanen ko no akma koy kakteh do cinai am ji ko na nganna o akman sang a kanen mangay no makwa. Ta maraherahet o kapacinara da jyaken no akma koy kakteh do cinai a marahet nya so onowned.
1238485,Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? ,"Jyabo kato ko ngonongonongan do vazay ko a, ta na nipamnekan yaken ni Kizisto amlivolivon no ciriciring na. Manngwa, ko jya nimacita si Yeso a Panirsirngen ta? Manngwa, beken a inyo na kakownongan no vazay ko ji Yeso? "
1238486,"If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.","Tana ji da panadnada yaken a nipamnekan ni Kizisto am cyaha, ta nyo panadnaden yaken a nipamnekan ni Kizisto. Ta inyo o yongkad na no kanimamnek na jyaken ni Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta."
1238487,"Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, ",No tamwaden da yaken a manci no kaji ko meyngongyodan a nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na am oya o itovis ko jira. 
1238488,Have we not power to eat and to drink? ,Jyabo kanig ko a patodahan da no sinjya so kanen ko do kapeylimwang ko no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a. 
1238489,"Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? ",Jyabo kapacitarek ko do karwan namen a nipamnekan ni Kizisto a. Akman so kakteh ta si Pite a ka nira wari na ni Yeso a mapalololo so kahanghangan da mangilili. 
1238490,"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? ","Manngwa, abo nakenakem nyo jyamen si Parnapo a yamnanao jinyo no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a kato namen ngonongonongan do kahakakaw namen a amyaw so velek namen? "
1238491,"Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? ",Sino o mangay do itaysang a tao a to ngonongonong do kanen na palolwen. Sino o meymowa so asi no kayo a jyangan so asi na. Sino jinyo o mangonong so kagling a ji meyyakan so kagling.
1238492,Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? ,Beken a ko to mancyan o akman sang a ciring. Ta yakman sang o ciring do iwawalam na ni Moyse. 
1238493,"For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? ","Ta maniring am, ""No peyvazain o baka am ji bengbenga o ngongoy da."" Manngwa, makdekdeng pa o baka a na ikarilaw ni Ama ta do to? "
1238494,"Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. ",Jyabo na kaji ngagazan jyamen no ciring eya. Tana mangay meymowa kano manlangi so mojis am abo ji ngakzeb so kapavonong da sira do nilangi da a mojis. 
1238495,"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? ",Yamen rana am namen nipanokos jinyo o manoyong a nanao na ni Ama ta do to. No nipanta nyo yamen am jyabo kalas namen a omahap so itoro nyo jyamen a. 
1238496,"If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. ",No akman sang o karwan no tao a mangakday jinyo am ikongo ikarahet namen akman sang so nakenakem jinyo. Am namen kajyakmanan so sang. Ta namen to liliwa o namen kakcin a kano namen kahen.

1238497,Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? ,"Manngwa, nyo jyatenngi o kapanta no meyvazay do rako a panaralayan a tao so kanen da? Akman sang o mapatanang so baka do rako a panaralayan, ta ipanta sira so vonong da do nipatanang ji Ama ta do to. "
1238498,Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. ,"Akman sang o meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Yeso, ta pakanen sira."
1238499,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. ",Am kaji ko nimangapan so kakzeben ko jinyo. O ko vatvatkan do akman sang a ciring am beken a ko yagom o kataotao ko an. Tana mawakwak ko no kakcin ko am apyahen ko o kabo no ngina na no inanao ko jinyo. 
1238500,"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! ","Am ikongo o pazwayan ko so kapeylimwang ko no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to, do nitoro na jyaken a vazay ko ni Ama ta do to. No si ji ko meylimwangan no ciriciring na am jyabo kapya ko a. "
1238501,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. ",No si to ko minaknakman o kapeylimwang ko no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am manoyong o kapangakday ko jinyo. Am na kanitomoro nya jyaken so akman sya vazay ko. So ko anoyngan jya ney makdeng na vazay ko. 
1238502,"What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.",Am ikongo o azaw ko ang. O mahap ko am kasaray ko a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a ji ngahap so itoro da jyaken a kahanhanan na ni Ama ta do to.
1238503,"For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. ","Yaken rana am yabo mapeylamlamsoy jyaken a tao. Am nakenakem ko o kakma koy lamlamsoy da no aro a tao, do ko kapanop sira. "
1238504,"And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; ","No macivazay ko do tao do Yotay am inarahen ko sira o tao do Yotay, do kakza ko no kapanop ko so aro a tao do Yotay. Tana ko na ji mangozai o iwawalam na ni Moyse am ko ahapen o iwawalam da, do ko kapanadnad sira a yapanopen. "
1238505,"to them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ, ) that I might gain them that are without law. ","Akman sang no kapacikaop ko do beken a tao do Yotay. Ta ko inarahen sira a ji ngahap so iwawalam na ni Moyse, do ko kahap sira yapanopen. Am beken a kaji ko ngonotan do iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to. Ta yako pangozayan o iwawalam na ni Kizisto. "
1238506,"To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. ","No macikaop ko do malelma so nakenakem a tao am panadnaden ko sira do kahap ko sira panopen. Am ori o panadnadan ko so iwawalam da no pacikaopan ko a tao, ta ori o ipanop ko sira a omanoyong ji Yeso. "
1238507,"And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.",Ko akmanan sang so vazay ko am ko ipatak o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Ta ori o ipakarara ko so karwan no tao a macizanod a somaray no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to.
1238508,"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. ","Katenngan nyo an. Tana aro o macipalalayo a tao am asa saon o azawen da am. Akman kamo so sang an, a makdeng a malalayo a kapakahap nyo so yazaw na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. "
1238509,And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. ,O abwangen da macipalalayo a tao am tey mazikna sira ori. Ta ori o ipakahap da so azaw da. Am o yata kakzeben am jyararalaw a azaw ta ji Ama ta do to. 
1238510,"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: ","Am ori o ko to mangononongi do ko kapalalayo, akman so maciopaopag do icyatatao, ta ji na to pazazaba o opaopagan na sya. "
1238511,"but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.",So ko apzatan do onowned ko.

1238512,"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; ","Manga kakteh, ko pazimanen jinyo o mina vazay no ineynapo ta a nimacihza ji Moyse.

Tana do onotan da do cinalab a tana no kapangonong da do awa am nimamimin sira niomonot ji Moyse do palolwan na sira. "
1238513,and did all eat the same spiritual meat; ,Akmey asa sira nikoman so nipakas na ni Ama ta do to a kanen a ngaranan da mana a nibsoy na sira. 
1238514,and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. ,Akmey asa sira niminom so ranom a nitoro na jira ni Ama ta do to a nimvoyog do vato. O vato rana am akmey kataotao na ni Yeso Kizisto a nimacihza jira. 
1238515,But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.,Am tana rako o nisidongan na sira ni Ama ta do to am apeleh sira o nimahap so vazay na tao. So nikaoyyan na nira ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o nikawakwak da do kabwan no nihakawan no tao.

1238517,"Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. ","So ji nyo nginarai so yatatasa ka tao jira a manaralay so malas a iraralay da, akman so ciring do Seysyo. Ta maniring am, ""No kapanaralay da so malas a iraralay da am makapya sira o aro a tao a malimolimot a amyop a koman a maganam."""
1238518,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. ","Ji tamo nginara sira o yatatasa ka tao a somagpyan a yabo so yapanganyanigan. Sira rana ori am kakatlwan a ranaw o ikatlo na zivo (23, 000) no tao a nimawakwak do kasaraw. "
1238519,"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. ","Ji tamo nginara o yatatasa ka tao a mileylamdam si Ama ta do to, ta nisongit da sira no aro a mavowaw a kawakwak da. "
1238520,"Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. ",Ji tamo nginara sira o yatatasa ka tao a meyoyaoya do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. Ta o meyoyaoya a tao no kanang am nibalinas na sira no tinsi na ni Ama ta do to.

1238523,"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.",O yana ilita jinyo ni Satan am yabo dang vayo.

1238524,"Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. ","Am ori an, ji kamo rana manaralay so malas a iraralay nyo, manga keypong an. "
1238525,I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. ,"Yako nanawen inyo a mateteneng a tao. Jyabo kaji nyo makatenngan do kanoyong na, kalas na no ciring ko a. "
1238526,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? ",O tamo ayopen a tamo iyapapaw si Yeso am tamo isaray ji Ama ta do to an. No tamo amyop so rala na ni Yeso a yata kakan so kataotao na am tamo akmey asa rana a macikaop ji Yeso Kizisto a nimawakwak no raraten ta.

1238528,Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? ,Naknakmen nyo o Isedi a tao a koman so patanangen da ji Ama ta do to a yamacizanod so nakem amraralay ni Ama ta do to.
1238529,"What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? ","Ikongo peypeypangayan no akman sang a ciring. Manngwa, manoyong o kakdeng na no malas a iraralay da kano pazos? "
1238530,"But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. ",Jyabo kakman na sang a.

1238537,"If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake. ",No pakanen da inyo no ji raralay ni Ama ta do to am no panamen da o kanen am ji nyo meyrahan. 
1238538,"But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof: ",Am no myan so akma moy kakteh do cinai a manci no kanimeypazos da no kanekanen am panadnaden nyo o manci nya tao.

1238541,"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. ","Am ori an, tana makakaday a vazay nyo a tana koman kamo a tana omyop kamo am naknakmen nyo o kazwazway nyo si Ama ta do to. "
1238542,"Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: ","Am ori an, ji nyo mamyapyai no kapacinara da jinyo a meyraraten no tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay a kano tao do peycyakyokyokayan na. "
1238543,"even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.",Inarahen nyo o mina vazay ko a mapasaray so aro a tao a ji mangozay do apyahen ko no nakem.

1238544,"Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.",Inarahen nyo yaken a ominara si Yeso Kizisto.
1238545,"Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.","Ko isaray inyo, ta nyo masangib yaken a yamanakem a yamangozay do nipamizing ko jinyo a iwawalam no kyokay. "
1238546,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. ",Am inaoy si katenngan nyo si Yeso Kizisto a tomalamozong ninyo a mahakay. O mahakay rana am ipeymatmatngeh da o mavakes da. Si Yeso Kizisto am onotan na si Ama ta do to. 
1238547,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. ",No meynozi sira kapangononong da no mahakay do kalwalovotan a meysakop am manoyong sira komolala si Kizisto. 
1238548,But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. ,Am no meynozi sira kapangononong da no mavakes do kalwalovotan no tao a kaji da bonbonan do oo da am manoyong sira komolala so kahanghangan da. O akman rana sang a mavakes am meyyangay sira kano nigolgolan da a mavakes. 
1238549,"For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. ",No ji da bonboni o oo da no mavakes am apyapya kato na rana nedtedan do avok da. No ipacimanig da o kapeygolgol da am bonbonan da o oo da. 
1238550,"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. ",Ji bonboni o oo da no mahakay. Ta kehngehngay da o kamamagen ni Ama ta do to a kano azwazway na. Am pacikazwayan no mavakes o mahakay. 
1238551,For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. ,Ta beken a mavakes o nikamaogan na no mahakay no kapangamaog na pa ni Ama ta do to so karawan. Ta o mavakes am mahakay nikamaogan na. 
1238552,Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. ,O nyamamaogan na ni Ama ta do to so mavakes am sidongen na o mahakay. 
1238553,For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. ,"Am ori o ipeyvazongot da no mavakes, do kapacita da nya do tinsi na ni Ama ta do to so kapacyanod da so nakem do mahakay na. "
1238554,"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. ",Am yaten rana amraralay ni Yeso a tao am masicyakarilaw o mahakay a kano mavakes do vazay an. 
1238555,"For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. ",Tana nimapo o ney manma a mavakes do mahakay am nimapodpod o mahakay do mavakes a kapo no makakaday a masaod no karawan ji Ama ta do to.
1238556,Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? ,"To nyo na naknakman. Manngwa, mazway o ji bonbon do oo da a mavakes do kalwalovotan a meynozi? "
1238557,"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? ","Manngwa, nyo jya kazazap no onowned nyo o kapacimanig no mapatovo so avok a mahakay? "
1238558,"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. ",O mavakes am ikazway da o anaro a avok da. Ta o anaro a avok da no mavakes am ibonbon da do oo da. 
1238559,"But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.",No si myan pa so jyalpid a tao am naknakmen na o kabo no meytarek a iwawalam ta. So da ikamimin no peycyakyokyokayan na yanan no yakman sang a iwawalam.
1238560,"Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. ",Yapa myan so ko ipanci jinyo. Ori rana am ko jyakzan o vazay nyo no kamo meylovolovot. Ta beken a nyo ikapya o nyo kalovot a yameynozi. Ta nyo ipeyparahet. 
1238561,"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. ",Ney manma na am yamyan so tao a yamanci nya jyaken so nyo ikavwavwak a yameykalyalipenpenan so nakenakem no kamo malwalovot a meynozi. Ko anoyngan no kanoyong no yatatasa dang a ciring. 
1238562,"For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. ",So na jyalasi no nyo kasyasyay so nakem. Ta ori o ipakateneng do manoyong rana so nakem ji Ama ta do to. 
1238563,"When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. ",No kanyo malwalovot a omapapaw si Kizisto am macitarek o yanyo naknakmen. 
1238564,"For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. ",Ta yamyan so yato manmanma koman a da keyyop. So na iyan no manowji a ji makapis so nipeylovolovot da kanen. Am ori o ipeykakcin da. 
1238565,"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. ","Manngwa, yabo kavahayan nyo a nyo akanan? Kamo manoyong saon a yakomolala so kyokay na ni Ama ta do to a yamapanyanig so ji makahakaw a tao. Akman ko na so wanjin a omnanao jinyo. Manngwa, azwazwain ko inyo? Jyabo kazwazway ko jinyo a."
1238566,"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: ","O ko ipamizing jinyo am nimahap ko ji Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. So ko nipancyan rana nya jinyo. Ahep no kapanazang da ni Yeso am ahapen na o pang, "
1238567,"and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.","a kasaray na nya ji Ama ta do to akcikcilen. Maniring am, ""Oya rana am kataotao ko ya a ivyay jinyo. So kanan nyo sya a iyapapaw nyo jyaken."" "
1238568,"After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.","Mateyka sira koman am akman so sang a mahap so ayoyopan. Maniring am, ""Oya rana am yongkad no vayo a pangozayan nyo a ciring na ni Ama ta do to a manci no kahap na jinyo do kanimvoyog ko ninyo no rala. So to nyo amwamooni sya a iyapapaw nyo jyaken."" "
1238569,"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. ","Mangday no kakan nyo so pang a omyop so potaw cyo eya o kapeylimwang nyo ni Yeso Kizisto a nimawakwak no raraten nyo, mangay do ikeypirwa na mai."
1238570,"Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. ","Am ori an, no myan so tao a koman so pang a keyyop na so amyan do ayoyopan a ji nakenakem so peypeypangayan na am manoyong kapeyraratenen na so sang a mapasala do kataotao na kano rala na ni Yeso. "
1238571,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. ","Am ori an, naknakman pa so karatan no kataotao a kakan rana sya, keyyop rana sya. "
1238572,"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. ",No kanen na o pang a keyyop na so yamyan do ayoyopan a kaji na makatenngan do peypeypangayan na am mangay jya o peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238573,"For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. ",Am ori o na iyan rana jinyo no yameykeyngeyngen a kano yanimawakwak. 
1238574,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. ",No panmanmahen ta pa o kanakenakem ta so nikaratan no onowned ta am jyabo kaoya na nyaten ni Ama ta do to a. 
1238575,"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. ",Am o oyyan na nyaten ni Ama ta do to am inanao na jyaten. Ta ori o ji ta macizanoji do ji nganoyong jya tao a peydednan na so peyoyaoyyan na no makwa.
1238576,"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. ","Am ori an, manga kakteh an. No malwalovot kamo a omapapaw si Yeso am macipananala kamo an. "
1238577,"And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.","No myan so makcin am manmanma koman do vahay da an, a kabo na no oyaoya na ninyo ni Ama ta do to no meylovolovot kamo. Yapa myan so ipanci ko jinyo am cyaha, ta ipanci ko no ipisa kai ko."
1238578,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. ","Manga kakteh, inaoy si mamimin kamo a makateneng do oyowyat a kano teneteneng a nitoro na jinyo no Seyzi. "
1238579,"Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. ","Naknakmen nyo pala no kaji nyo pa nganoyngan ji Yeso. Jyabo kaji na nitomalamozongan ninyo ni Satan a, do kanimraralay nyo no malas a iraralay nyo. "
1238580,"Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.","Am nyo rana anoyngan si Yeso.

Akman sang an, ta o italamozong na no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to o manci no kanoyong ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta."
1238581,"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. ",Tana yameykataretarek o oyowyat a kano teneteneng ta am yasa o Seyzi a yamanta nyaten so sang. 
1238582,"And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. ",Tana yameykataretarek o vazay ta a somidong so akma tey kakteh do cinai am yasa o Panirsirngen ta a ta hapen so vazay. 
1238583,"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. ",Tana yameykataretarek o vazay ta am yasa si Ama ta do to a yaomoyat jyaten. 
1238584,But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. ,Tana yameykataretarek o na itoro jyaten no Seyzi a oyowyat na am yamamimin ori a yamakasidong so akma tey kakteh do cinai. 
1238585,For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; ,"O Seyzi rana am na itoro do yasa ka tao o teneteneng a makateneng do nanao na ni Ama ta do to. Yakman sang, ta na itoro do yasa ka tao o teneteneng na yana ipangnanao. "
1238586,to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; ,"Yakman sang, ta na itoro do yasa ka tao o kakdeng no nakenakem na ji Ama ta do to, a na katoro nya do yasa ka tao so oyowyat na a yamvonas so ingingnen no tao. "
1238587,to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: ,"Akman sang, ta itoro no Seyzi do tao o oyowyat na mapeyvazay so mapeyzokab a vazay, a na katoro nya do yasa ka tao so oyowyat na mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to, a na katoro nya do yasa ka tao so teneteneng na mapeypinpin so manoyong a oyowyat no Seyzi a kano oyowyat na ni Satan, a na katoro nya do yasa ka tao so oyowyat na a meyzezyak so macitarek a ciring apo do Seyzi, a na katoro nya do yasa ka tao so teneteneng na a mapeyvaliw so ciring a nipanci da. "
1238588,"but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.",Am o yamakakaday a oyowyat a kano teneteneng am asa o na yapwan. Iya rana am Seyzi a mangay tomoro no oyowyat na do aro a tao. Ori rana am nakenakem na no Seyzi o katoro na nya jyaten so oyowyat ta kano teneteneng ta.
1238589,"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. ",Yasa o kataotao ta am yameykataretarek o peyvongvongwan ta. Tamo akman sang an. Tana ta aro a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to am tamo yakmey asaha a kataotao na ni Kizisto. 
1238590,"For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. ","Am ori o tana tao do Yotay ta, tana beken a tao do Yotay ta am tana lamlamsoy da yaten am tana to ta ngonongonongi o vazay ta am cyaha. Ta tamo na nimamimin a nitaktakan no Seyzi. So ta icyakmey yasa ka tao so kataotao a yana italamozong no yasa ka Seyzi."
1238591,"For the body is not one member, but many. ",Beken a yasa o na kamamaogan no kataotao ta. Ta yaro yameycyataretarek a peyvongvongwan ta. 
1238592,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? ","No si maniring o ai am, ""Beken a lima ko. Am ori o ji ko macirapai do kataotao."" Am jyakman sang a ji macirapa do kataotao an. "
1238593,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? ","No si maniring o talinga am, ""Ji ko macirapa do kataotao, ta beken a mata ko."" Am jyakman sang a ji macirapa do kataotao an. "
1238594,"If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? ",No si mamimin o kataotao a mata am makongo a mangamizing. No si mamimin o kataotao a talinga am makongo ori a manhangno. 
1238595,"But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. ",Am to na mangozai ni Ama ta do to o nakem na mapeykapyapinpin so makakaday do kataotao ta an. 
1238596,"And if they were all one member, where were the body? ",Am no si meyyangangay sira am abneken ori a kataotao? 
1238597,"But now are they many members, yet but one body. ",Tana yaro yameykataretarek do kataotao ta am yasa o kataotao ta.
1238598,"And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. ","Am ori o ji na mapeyciringi no mata do lima so, ""Yabwata yako keylamnayan nimo."" Akman sang oo, ta ji na peycirnga do ai o kabo no keylamnayan na nya. "
1238599,"Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: ",So yana jyakmani sang an. Ta o yata ipanci a jyakdeng a peyvongvongwan ta am amyan so ta keylamnayan nya. 
1238600,"and those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. ",O yata ipanci a yajyakdeng do kataotao ta am ta peyveyveknen a yapzatan. Am ori o na ikazway rana. 
1238601,"For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: ",O yapiya peyvongvongwan ta am ta ji bonboni. Ta yamazway na nimaogan sya ni Ama ta do to. O na nyamaogan sya ni Ama ta do to so peyvongvongwan ta am mamimin a makdeng. 
1238602,that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. ,So icyakma dey asa a macisidosidong. 
1238603,"And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. ",No myan so meyngen do kataotao am todamimin o kataotao a meyngen. No myan so azwazway no asa ka kakamay ta am todamimin o kataotao ta a masaray.
1238604,"Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. ",Inyo rana am kataotao na inyo ni Kizisto. So ikamimin nyo akma ney kataotao. 
1238605,"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. ","Do kyokay na ni Ama ta do to am yamakakaday o tao a nipamnekan na mahap so vazay na. O ney manma na am nipamnekan na ni Yeso a amlivolivon no ciriciring na. Tomonton am mangononong so ciriciring na.

"
1238606,Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? ,"Am beken a todamimin sira nipamnekan na ni Yeso a amlivolivon no ciriciring a kano mangononong so ciriciring na kano mangnanao no ciriciring na. So ji da todamimin a mapeyvazay so mapeyzokab a vazay, "
1238607,Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? ,a kano manvonas so ingingnen a kano meyzezyak so macitarek a ciring a kano mapeyveyvaliw so ciriciring da. 
1238608,But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.,Am naknakmen nyo o kakza nyo no ney yapya na teneteneng a kano oyowyat a isidong nyo so icyatatao nyo. So yako pananawan nya jinyo so ney yapiya na pangozayan nyo.
1238609,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. ",Tana katenngan ko a ipanci o makakaday a ciriciring no tao a kano ciriciring no tinsi a kabo no pangangarilawan ko so icyatatao ko am katonodan no ciring ko o manilo a vaklit. 
1238610,"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. ","Tana mateneng ko a mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a yanan no makakaday a teneng a makateneng do nanao na ni Ama ta do to a mowyat so nakenakem a to rana makapeylis so tokon a mangay do awa, kabo no pangangarilawan ko so icyatatao ko am ikongo peypeypangayan na no nang. "
1238611,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. ","Tana to ko mangazawan o kangangay ko mangay do kataotao ko ji ko mangbeywani a isidong ko so tao, a kabo no pangangarilawan ko so icyatatao ko am abwata o kapyapyan ko nya."
1238612,"Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, ",O meyngongyod a mangarilaw so icyatatao na am to nazibwan o oyaoyyan da no kataotao. Kapiya no nakenakem. Ji manginanahet. Ji mapazway. Ji mapakarakarang so nakenakem. 
1238613,"doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; ",Ji mapeyvazay so malas a vazay. Jyararaten. Jyaoyaoyahen. Ji na peyyana do onowned na o karatan no tao. 
1238614,"rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; ",Ji nakzan o somala vazay. O manoyong a vazay o ikakza na. 
1238615,"beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. ",O mangarilaw so icyatatao na am to na peyyopowpasa o iraherahet da sya no icyatatao na. Anoyngan na o keyyan no kasaraw a ipamlis da. To peycyabobwa o makakaday a oyaoyyan da no kataotao.
1238616,"Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. ","O pangangarilawan rana am jyavitos. Ta to meyyonong o kapangarilaw so tao. Am o teneteneng do pangananawan am mavivitos. Akman sang o meyzezyak so macitarek a ciring. Ta amyan so kasaraw a ikavitos na. Akman sang, ta ji meyyonownay o teneteneng a makateneng do nanao na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238617,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. ","Ta o ta katenngan sicyaikwaya am katey na pa ori. O teneteneng ta a mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am akman sang, ta katey na pa ori. "
1238618,"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. ",Am no si marateng rana o yai na ni Yeso no makwa am ji ta rana ngahapa o ji makanet a teneteneng. Ta meyyopowpas rana ori.
1238619,"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. ","No ka kanakan ko pa am kanakan o ciring ko. Akman sang o vazay ko a kano aktokto ko. Ko na makaveyvow am ko jyakman sang, ta ko na rarakeh rana so pangtoktwan. "
1238620,"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. ","O tamo katenngan sicyaikwaya am akmey avwavong apo do kowpasan a kagami a jyasingkad. Am no makwa am mapengkad ta rana. So ta pa ji makamimini si Ama ta do to a katenngan sicyaikwaya. Am no makwa am manoyong o kapakateneng ta rana jya, akman si Ama ta do to a makamimin jyaten a yakatenngan. "
1238621,"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.",Am o panganoyngan ta kano sarasaray ta no makwa kano pangangarilawan am to meyyonong. Am ney makdeng na pa am pangangarilawan do yameykatlo ang.
1238622,"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy. ","Am ori o ikakdekdeng nyo pa mangarilaw so icyatatao nyo. Akman sang, ta ikakza nyo o teneteneng a kano oyowyat a itoro na jinyo no Seyzi. Am ney makdeng na am mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238623,"For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. ","Ta o meyzezyak so macitarek a ciring apo do Seyzi am beken a tao o peycirngan na sya, ta si Ama ta do to, do kabo no tao a makateneng jya amizngen. "
1238624,"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. ","Am o mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am tao o nanawen na. Ta isidong na sira, ipait na sira, ipasaray na so onowned da no amyan so alalaw da. "
1238625,He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. ,O manci no macitarek a ciring am kataotao na o masidong na. O mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a tao am masidong na o tao do kyokay. 
1238626,"I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.",Inaoy si mamimin kamo a meyciring so macitarek a ciring. Am ko apyapyahen pa inyo a mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Ta no myan so tao a mapeyvaliw so macitarek a ciring am ori o ipakasidong na so tao do kyokay. No si abo o mapeyvaliw sya am makdekdeng pa o kapangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a kano meyciring so macitarek a ciring.
1238627,"Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? ","Am ori an, manga kakteh an. No si mangay ko jinyo a kapangononong ko no ji nyo a tenngi a ciring am ikongo peypeypangayan na no akman sang. Si ahapen ko saon o ciring nyo a mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am ori o ipakasidong ko jinyo saon am. "
1238628,"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? ",No si malas o patbokan da so anood am abo tao a makateneng do anwanood. 
1238629,"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? ",No avyotan o ipaziman so tao a kaji na pengkadan am sino do itaysang o makateneng do kapeyliliman da. 
1238630,"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. ",Akman sang o macitarek a ciring nyo an. Ta no abo tao a makateneng do peypeypangayan na am akma kamoy macisirsiring do pagpag. 
1238631,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification. ",Yaro yamakakaday a ciring do karawan am abwata yasa dang a yajyatenngi no tao so peypeypangayan. 
1238632,"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me. ",No ji ko a tenngi o peypeypangayan no ciring a ipanci da jyaken no macisirsiring jyaken a tao am akma nameney apo do matarek a pongso a ji makateneng do ciring no kadwan jyamen. 
1238633,"Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. ",No nyo tey kakza o teneteneng a kano oyowyat apo do Seyzi am naknakmen nyo o kakza nyo no makasidong so nakenakem da ji Ama ta do to no akma nyoy kakteh do cinai.
1238634,Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret. ,Am ori an. Ta o makza no kapeyciring so macitarek a ciring am ipeynozi na o kapakateneng na jya peyvaliwen. 
1238635,"For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. ",Ta no meynozi ko no macitarek a ciring am onowned ko o meynozi. Am abo do pangtoktwan ko. 
1238636,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. ",No akman sang am makongo so wanjin. No meynozi ko am meynozi o onowned ko a kano akman sang a aktokto ko a meynozi. Akman sang no meyyanwanood ko. 
1238637,"Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? ","No si isaray mo ji Ama ta do to no macitarek a ciring am manngwa, katenngan da o inozi mo no macipeynozi jimo? No si manoyong o kakman na sang am makongo sira macizanod jimo a manci no, ""Amin,"" do ji da tenngi. "
1238638,"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. ",Tana apya o inozi mo ji Ama ta do to am ji na sidong o karwan no tao. 
1238639,"I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: ",Ko isaray ji Ama ta do to. Ta yabo yamakataha jyaken a masangib a makalavat so macitarek a ciring. 
1238640,"yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.",Am no malwalovot a meynozi am apyapyahen ko pa o alima ka ciring a katenngan da amizngen no tao a makananao sira a kano meykazivozivo a ciring a ji da tenngi amizngen no tao.
1238641,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men. ","So ipeypakatkat nyo, manga kakteh so pangtoktwan an. Akman kamo so mina tazak a tao a ji nakenakem so raraten. "
1238642,"In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord. ","Maniring do Seysyo am, ""Pacisirsirngan ko o aro a tao no macitarek a ciring. Mamnek ko so tao do matarek a pongso a macisirsiring jira. Am yada yaken ji ngamiznga."""
1238643,"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe. ",So ikanoyong na no macitarek a ciring a yongkad no oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to. Am ori rana am ipaziman so ji nganoyong ji Yeso a tao. Am o mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am ipeypahagnat so nakenakem da no amraralay ni Ama ta do to a tao. 
1238644,"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad? ",No malwalovot kamo do kyokay a meynozi a kamimin nyo meyzezyak so matarek a ciring am no somdep sira o ji manaralay a tao am jyabo kaji da mancyan ninyo a zomyak a. 
1238645,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: ","Am no malovot kamo a mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a kasdep da no ji manaralay a tao am jyabo kaji da makanakman so raraten da, do pakamizngan da so ipanci nyo a ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238646,"and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.","O meyyomomon do onowned na a raraten am jyabo kaji na ngablisan jya a omraralay rana ni Ama ta do to, do kanoyong na do kapacikaop na jinyo ni Ama ta do to."
1238647,"How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. ","Manga kakteh, akman so wanjin o pangozayan nyo. No malovot kamo a meynozi am amyan so meyyanwanood. Amyan so mangnanao. Amyan so mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Amyan so macitarek so ciring. Amyan so mapeyvaliw sya. Naknakmen nyo o kapeypahagnat da so nakenakem no makakaday a vazay no sinjya. Ta ori o manoyong an. "
1238648,"If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. ",No myan so meyzezyak so macitarek a ciring am karwan na o tatlo a mapalipalit. Am amyan so mapeyvaliw so peypeypangayan na no nang. 
1238649,"But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. ",No si abo tao a mapeyvaliw so ciring na am ji rana meyzezyak o macitarek so ciring a tao an. Apyapya rana kato na ngyanan do onowned na a manci nya ji Ama ta do to. 
1238650,"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. ",Am o mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am apya ka rarwa da am tatlo no manci nya. O mangamizing a tao am pakamizngen da o kanoyong na kalas na no ciring da. 
1238651,"If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. ",Am no si myan so amlisna tao a yanan no nimapo ji Ama ta do to a ciring am o nimanmanma a nimyan so ciring a tao am to rana neyked. 
1238652,"For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. ",Apya kapalipalit nyo a mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a kamimin nyo a karapan so onowned. 
1238653,And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. ,"O yanan no teneteneng a mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a tao am ingtwan na o kataotao na, ta ji to meyzezyakan. "
1238654,"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.","Ta o yaomoyat jira Tao do to am beken a yamapeyzavozavoz so vazay. Ta na twatontonen o vazay na. O iwawalam do peycyakyokyokayan na am, "
1238655,"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. ",ji meyzezyak o mavakes do kalwalovotan no tao a meynozi akman so domket do Seysyo. Ta kapangamizing da no mavakes. 
1238656,"And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. ",No myan so kakzeben da katenngan am to da pacicya o kahanghangan da do vahay da. Ta o meyzezyak do kalwalovotan no tao a mavakes am jyazway o akman sang. 
1238657,What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?,"Ala yamyan so yaji ngahap so ko inanao jinyo ya. Manngwa, yanimapo jinyo o nanao na ni Ama ta do to? Manngwa, inyoo o yana nanawen?"
1238658,"If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. ",No myan so tao a yamanci no kapangononong na so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a kano manci no keyyan no oyowyat na jya no Seyzi am naknakmen na o yadomket do teygami ko ya. Ta yamonganay ori ji Ama ta do to. 
1238659,"But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. ",No myan so ji ngahap sya am ji nyo ngamiznga.
1238660,"Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. ","Am ori manga kakteh an, kakzan nyo no mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to an. Am ji nyo nengsengi o meyciring so macitarek a ciring an. "
1238661,Let all things be done decently and in order.,Pangozayan nyo o kapeycyapyapinpinan no vazay an.
1238662,"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; ","Manga kakteh, manakem nyo o ninanao ko jinyo no kakwa a Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Ori rana am nyahap nyo na yamanoyong a yanyo pangozayan. "
1238663,"by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. ","O Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to o nipakahap nyo so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad nyo. So pangozayan nyo jya an, ta no si ji nyo mangozay am abo o peypeypangayan na no kanoyong nyo ji Yeso Kizisto."
1238664,"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; ",Ninanao ko na jinyo o yaney makdeng na nimahap ko ji Yeso. Ori rana am nimawakwak si Yeso no raraten ta. So na idket do Seysyo no ciring eya. 
1238665,"and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: ",Nipakakasa da si Yeso. Ikatlo na araw am mirwa a mavyay. So na idket pa do Seysyo no akman sang a ciring. 
1238666,"and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: ",Nimapacita si Yeso ji Pite a kangay na rana mapacita do karwan da no nipamnekan na amlivolivon no ciriciring na. 
1238667,"after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. ",Meyratateng am mangay mapacita do nimacihza pa jya kakaliman na poo (500) a tao. Sira rana ori am amyan pa jira ang so yamavyay. Yamyan rana jira so nimawakwak. 
1238668,"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. ",Meyratateng am mapacita pa ji Yake a kangay na pa mapacita do nipamnekan na amlivolivon no ciriciring na tao. 
1238669,"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. ",Ney manowji na am mapacita jyaken. So yako ipacipanownowji a niomanoyong ji Yeso.
1238670,"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. ","Ta ney marahet ko na jira nipamnekan na ni Yeso a amlivolivon no ciriciring na. So ikanoyong ko a ji na abneka ni Yeso a lamlamsoy na, ta niraherahet ko o kyokay na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238671,"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. ","Am o pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to o ko ikakman sya. Yamanoyong o pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a nitoro na jyaken. Am ori o ko ikaharahara pa a yameyvazay a kano karwan namen a nipamnekan na ni Yeso. Am beken a kowyowyat ko a meyvazay, ta si Ama ta do to am ori o yamacipeyvazay jyaken. "
1238672,"Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.","Am ori an, tana yaken a tana karwan namen a nipamnekan na ni Yeso am namen mamimin a yameylimwang nya. So nyo icyakman sang a yaomanoyong jya."
1238673,"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? ",No yamanoyong namen kapeylimwang ni Kizisto a nimirwa a mavyay am ikongo na iyan jinyo no tao a yamanci no kaji mirwan a mavyay no nimawakwak rana tao. 
1238674,"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: ",No ji mirwa a mavyay o tao am ji nimirwa a mavyay saon si Kizisto am. 
1238675,"and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. ",No jya nimirwa a mavyay si Kizisto am jyabo angangayan no kapeylimwang namen nya. Jyabo peypeypangayan no kanoyong nyo ji Yeso a. 
1238676,"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. ",No si akman sang am manoyong o kapangamaog namen ni Ama ta do to so malas a ciring. Ta no namen maniring am na nivyay ni Ama ta do to si Kizisto. No manoyong o kabo no tao a mirwa a mavyay am manoyong o kaji na nimapeyvangonan si Kizisto ni Ama ta do to. 
1238677,"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: ",Ta no ji mirwa a mavyay o tao am jyabo kanimirwa na mavyay ni Kizisto a. 
1238678,"and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. ",No ji nimirwa a mavyay si Kizisto am abo o peypeypangayan no kanoyong nyo jya. So ikanoyong nyo amyan pa do peyraratenan nyo. 
1238679,Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. ,No si manoyong o akman sang am to makasi sira o nimawakwak rana amraralay ni Yeso. 
1238680,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.",No si ipeyhanhan ta si Kizisto a somidong jyaten sicyaikwaya a kaji ta makatenngan do kanoyong na mapeyvangon jyaten a ahapen do teyngato no makwa am to tamo makasi a tao do karawan.
1238681,"But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. ",Am yajyakman sang an. Ta yamanoyong si Kizisto a yanimirwa a mavyay. Ori rana am yongkad no kanoyong da mirwa a mavyay no yarana nimawakwak a yamraralay nya a tao. 
1238682,"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. ","Si Adam o yapwan no kawakwak no tao. Akman sang, ta si Yeso Kizisto o yapwan no keypirwa a mavyay no tao. "
1238683,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. ",Akman sang an. Ta o da ikawakwak no tao am sira pa macirapa so inawan ji Adam. O ipeyvangon da no amraralay ni Yeso a tao am macikownongan rana sira ji Kizisto. 
1238684,But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. ,"Am matwatonton o tao a mirwa a mavyay. Ney manma am si Kizisto. O tomonton am amraralay nya tao, no si marateng o araraw no yai na ni Kizisto, "
1238685,"Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. ",a kapakaranes na rana no pangavosan no karawan. No si marateng o araraw no nang am balinasen na ni Kizisto o oyowyat no jyacita a kalamsoyan na ni Satan a kavosoyan na ni Ama ta do to a katoro na rana ni Yeso no karawan ji Ama ta do to a italamozong na. 
1238686,"For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. ",Tana abo pa o akman sang a vazay am jyablis si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen do yanam na pa ni Ama ta do to ambalinas so kavosoyan na. 
1238687,The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. ,O ney manowji na balinasen ni Ama ta do to am kawakwakan no tao. So ikabo rana no mawakwak a tao. 
1238688,"For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. ","Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a meymatmatngeh no karawan."" O karawan a na malavat do jya am ji macyangay dang si Ama ta do to. Ta iya o nitomoro nya ji Kizisto so oyowyat na a tomalamozong no karawan. "
1238689,"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.",Am no si marateng rana o araraw no ikakata na ni Kizisto am miminen na o karawan a italamozong. Am ji na meysopoi o oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to. So ikanoyong na rana mazway a meymatmatngeh no karawan ni Ama ta do to.
1238690,"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? ",No ji mirwa a mavyay o tao am ikongo peypeypangayan no icicirawat nyo a tomaktak do mavyay a tao a izagom nyo so nimawakwak a tao. 
1238691,And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? ,Ikongo namen to nomoki sya no kalalavitan no inawan namen. 
1238692,"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. ","Manga kakteh, ko mangday so araraw a yatoda jyangangay so inawan. Yamanoyong ori o ciring ko jinyo an. Ta yako tey saray nyo kapacikaop rana ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. "
1238693,"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die. ",Akman so mina alalaw ko do Ivoso. Ta mina akma koy to maciliman do masozi a kokoman so tao do peyrehrehtan da jyaken no tao. No ji mirwa a mavyay o nimawakwak a tao am tana to tamo rana mamaring so kanen do araraw am ibnek so kaji ta limanan do kadadayan na so araraw.
1238694,Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. ,Ji kamo todakakey a kalittan. No macikagagan ka do somagpyan a tao am mangay kapasagpyan na jimo so icicirawat. 
1238695,"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.",Paolin nyo o nakenakem nyo do kapyapyan. Paseykeden nyo na o kapeyraraten nyo. Yatatasa jinyo a yana ji makateneng ji Ama ta do to. O ko peycirngan sya am kapakateneng nyo do kanigan nyo.
1238696,"But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? ","No maniring o tao am, ""Sino ipanci o kato mirwan a mavyay no tao. Akman so wanjin o kamamagenan da nira ang."" "
1238697,"Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: ",Oyod nyo a kasagpyan a tao. No jyawakwak o nipamowa mo a vettow no kayo am jyabo kalida na. 
1238698,"and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: ","Abo mapamowa so meyvoovoong rana mowamowa, ta o vettow na o pamowahen, akman so avyas no kadai. "
1238699,"but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. ",Na to mangozai ni Ama ta do to o nakenakem na do na mamaogan so vettow. Akman sang an. Ta to macilolo o mahap mo do nipamowa mo a vettow.
1238700,"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. ","Yakman sang o kataotao no nyamamaog na ni Ama ta do to, ta yameykataretarek. O tao am tao so kamamagenan. Omalalam am omalalam so kamamagenan. Meyyasasalap am meyyasasalap so kamamagenan. Among am among so kamamagenan. "
1238701,"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. ",Yakman sang o masaod no hanit. Ta o kapyapya no masaod no hanit am yaji meyyangay a kano masaod no teyrahem so kapyapya. 
1238702,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. ",Araw am yamyan so na ipaniniray. O vehan am yamyan so na ipaniniray. Akman sang o mata no hanit a matarek so ipaniniray. So da ipeykataretarek no kazngazngang no mata no hanit.
1238703,So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: ,"Akman so sang, ta meytarek o kataotao ta do teyngato a kado teyrahem. Ta no si mirwa ta mavyay am vayo rana o kataotao ta a ji rana wakwak. "
1238704,it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: ,O nibobo rana tao am abo o oyowyat na. Am no mirwa ta mavyay am tey mazway ta na. 
1238705,"it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. ",O kataotao ta am ori o ibobo. Am o mirwa a mavyay a kataotao am vayo rana ori a mavyay do teyngato. No manoyong keyyan no kataotao ta do karawan am manoyong keyyan no kataotao ta do teyngato. 
1238706,"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. ","Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Si Adam am tao kamamaogan na."" Am o ipanci a manowji a Adam am si Kizisto a manta nyaten so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta. "
1238707,"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. ",Manmanma o kataotao ta do karawan a keyyan na rana no monganay do teyngato a kataotao ta. 
1238708,"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. ",O ney manma na tao a si Adam am nyamaog na ni Ama ta do to no tana. O manowji a Adam am si Kizisto. Iya rana am nimapo do teyngato. 
1238709,"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. ",O tao do teyrahem am akman sira si Adam so kataotao a nimapo do tana. O tao do teyngato am akman sira si Yeso so kataotao. 
1238710,"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. ",So na iyan rana jyaten no kataotao ta do karawan. Am no makwa am amyan rana so kamamagen ta a kataotao ta do teyngato akman so kataotao na ni Yeso.
1238711,"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. ","Manga kakteh, o ko ipanci am o kataotao ta sicyaikwaya am ji macikaop do italamozong na ni Ama ta do to no makwa, ta mawakwak o kataotao ta do teyrahem eya."
1238712,"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, ",Amizngen nyo o mapeyzokab a nanao a jya nipatwaw pa no kakwa a nipanci na jyaken ni Ama ta do to. Beken a to ta mimin a mawakwak. Am mamimin ta mablis so kataotao. 
1238713,"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. ","Am makeykai ori, akmey peyrektan no mata. No si mamizing no tao o ney manowji rana ipatao jyaten a zapa am makaranes rana o akman sang a vazay a kapeyoli da mavyay no mawakwak a tao a kaji da rana wakwakan. So icyakman ta sang a mablis so kataotao. "
1238714,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. ",Ta o kataotao ta na do karawan am mablis rana a kaji na rana wakwakan. 
1238715,"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. ","No mateyka rana ori am ori o ipangononong na rana no ciring do Seysyo. Ta maniring am, ""Na rana nibalinas o kawakwak no tao. So ikabo na rana no tao a mawakwak."""
1238716,"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? ","""So ikabo rana no kanyaheyan ta no kawakwak ta. So ikabo rana no mazabab so onowned a tao."""
1238717,The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. ,O kanyaheyan da no kawakwak da no tao am ikanyahey da o kaoya na nira ni Ama ta do to do kapeyraraten da. O ipeyraraten da am ji da ngapa o iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238718,"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. ","Am ta isaray ji Ama ta do to. Ta si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta o yarana nimapakavos so vazay na. So ta na jyanyahei a mawakwak, ta yana rana niovayan yaten do raraten ta."
1238719,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.","Am ori an, manga keypong an, makakdeng kamo so nakenakem ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. Makowyat kamo a mapeyvazay so vazay na. Cyaha, ta nyo katenngan o kaji na liklikan so mapeyvazay so vazay na tao."
1238720,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. ",O peysinsinmowen rana isidong so sinjya do Yelosaleng am to nyo manginarai o mina ciring ko so peycyakyokyokayan na do Cyalatay. 
1238721,"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. ","Mangday ka niciyo na o kamimin nyo a mapasina do nizpi nyo a nimahap nyo a kakpeh nyo sya. Am to nyo palolwa do karwaro no nimahap nyo a nizpi o pasinahen nyo. Ji nyo nanala yaken, ta to nyo ngonongonongi o kapeysinsinmo nyo sya. "
1238722,"And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. ",No si makaranes ko na am manovoy ko so ipeyhanhan nyo a tao a maciralay do teygami a kano nipeysinsinmo nyo a nizpi a yangay da do Yelosaleng. 
1238723,"And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.",Am no si paciralayan ko nizpi am to sira na macihza jyaken a mangay.
1238724,"Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia. ",Yaken rana am ko meyliktaw do Maciton. Si mateyka ko a itazogaw o aro a kyokay do Maciton am mangay ko jinyo. 
1238725,"And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. ",Ala miseysan ko jinyo do dang so makanateng a araw. Ala si mavitos rana o amyan am ori o yangay ko rana mangilili a sidongen nyo pa yaken a meypangay do angayan ko. 
1238726,"For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. ",Ta no si apyahen na ni Ama ta do to am ko ikakza o kownay ko pa a macikaop jinyo do dang. 
1238727,But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. ,Am to ko pa vezed do Ivoso eya mangay do araraw no ipamarimaring ta so kanen a somaray no nihakawan ta. 
1238728,"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.",Tana yaro yamrahet jyaken a yameylimwang no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am ko ji macimazai. Ta yatey yaro o makza no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to.
1238729,"Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. ","No si mangay si Timotay jinyo dang am taotawwen nyo an, a kapiya na no onowned na an. Ta yanamen meyyangay a yamahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238730,"Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.",Ji nyo ngolala. Ta sidongen nyo a meypangay jyaken do jya. Ta yako nanalahen si Timotay a kano kakehza na a mai jyaken do jya.
1238731,"As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.","O kakteh ta si Apolo am ko masangib a ipanci jya o kakekehza da sira kakteh ta mangay tomazogaw ninyo. Am na sapasapan pa. Cyaha, ta amyan so kasaraw a yangay na jinyo."
1238732,"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. ",Meytataziman kamo an. Makahadpet kamo so nakenakem a omraralay ni Ama ta do to. Ji kamo a nyahey. 
1238733,Let all your things be done with charity.,Pangozayan nyo o pangangarilawan na do makakaday a vazay nyo.
1238734,"I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints, ) ","Nyo katenngan sira Setiva yasa ka vahay, ta sira rana yasa ka vahay do Sila am ney manma sira niomanoyong ji Yeso a tao a tey mowyat a somidong so sinjya.

1238735,"that ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth. ",Am ori o amizngen nyo so akman sang a tao a kano kararay da mahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to. Amizngen nyo o yokodan da ninyo.
1238736,I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. ,Ko masaray do da kanimai da Setiva kani Votonato a kani Akayko. Yakmey kataotao nyo sira do nyo ikabo do jya. 
1238737,For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.,Tana yaken a tana inyo am tamo meyyangay a yasomaray nira. O akman rana sira ya am ikanig nyo sira ya an.
1238738,"The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. ",Da ipeyminaminasi inyo no peycyakyokyokayan na do Yasiya.

1238742,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. ,Inaoy si itoro na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta o pangangarilawan na jinyo.
1238743,"My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. The first epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, and Timotheus.","Ko ikarilaw inyo, ta kamo macikaop ji Yeso Kizisto."
1238744,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia: ",Yaken rana am si Pawlo ko a lamlamsoy na ni Ama ta do to a yana nipamnekan ni Yeso Kizisto a amlivolivon no ciriciring na.

1238746,"Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; ",Isaray tamo ji Ama na ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. Ta iya rana am yamanoyong a yamarilaw nyaten a yana yapwan no makakaday a mapasaray so tao. 
1238747,"who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. ",Na sidongen yamen do aro a alalaw namen. So ikanoyong namen a mangozay do pangangarilawan na a marilaw no makasazi so makakaday a alalaw da tao. 
1238748,"For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. ","Tana arako alalaw a mai jyamen do kahap namen so vazay ni Kizisto am cyaha, ta ikarakorako no sidongan na jyamen ni Kizisto. "
1238749,"And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. ","No makasazi namen so alalaw am cyaha, ta ipeypapya nyo.

1238750,"And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation. ",Am ori o namen peyhanhanan ninyo a jyagogad so onowned. Ta namen katenngan inyo a yamacizanod jyamen so alalaw. So icyakman nyo sang a macizanod do sarasaray a itoro na jyaten ni Ama ta do to.
1238751,"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: ","Manga kakteh, ko kakzeben inyo a makateneng do alalaw namen no keyyan namen pa do Yasiya pongso. Ta teywara o mina alalaw namen. Ori o ji namen ngatatai do kavyay namen. "
1238752,"but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: ",O nakenakem namen rana do onowned namen am to namen anoyngi o kawakwak namen. O peypeypangayan no nang am ipakateneng namen do kaji namen meyhanhanan no kataotao namen. Ta si Ama ta do to o ipeyhanhan namen a mamyay so nimawakwak a tao. 
1238753,"who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us; ",Na nipahawa yamen do yamakakaday a kanginanawan namen. So namen peyhanhanan ni Ama ta do to a somidong jyamen a mangay no makwa. 
1238754,"ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.","No si ipeynozi nyo yamen am jyabo kaji na nidongan jyamen ni Ama ta do to, do kamizing na so inozi nyo jyamen. So sarayan da no akman sang ji Ama ta do to no aro a tao."
1238755,"For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. ","Namen isaray o na kapeypalanginan no nakenakem namen ni Ama ta do to do karawan. Am beken a teneteneng namen ori, ta namen pangozayan o teneteneng na kano pangangasyan ni Ama ta do to.

1238756,"For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; ","Ta o namen nivatvatkan a ciring jinyo am o yanyo katenngan a vilangan. So namen kakzan ninyo a makateneng do vazay namen, "
1238757,"as also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.",a kapiya na rana no nakenakem nyo jyamen.

1238758,"And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit; ",Am ori o ko naknakman so keypirwa ko a mangay jinyo do dang. So ikanoyong nyo a ipidwa somaray. 
1238759,"and to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Jud&#230; a. ",No si meypangay ko do Maciton am ko pinanakman o kapanmanma ko a mangay jinyo do dang. No si meysinaoli ko am mangay ko pa jinyo. Ta sidongen nyo yaken a mangay do Yotay. 
1238760,"When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? ","Manoyong o kanimamnek ko jya am ji ko nimangay. Manngwa, ipanci rana o akman sang a mabliblis so nakem? No katatay ko do akman sang a vazay ko am manngwa, ko to ngonongonongi o onowned ko a manci no ka noon ko sya, ka beken ko sya? "
1238761,"But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. ",Am beken a akman so nyo ipanci. Ta o ipanci ko jinyo a ciring am beken a yameyveyvalyat. Ta si Ama ta do to a ko anopen am yabo na kalasan. 
1238762,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. ",Akman sang o Anak na ni Ama ta do to a si Yeso Kizisto a yanamen nipeylimwang jinyo si Sila kani Timotay. Ta jyabliblis o ciring na. Ta o nipatwaw na rana ni Yeso a ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am pangononongan na a peyvazain. 
1238763,"For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. ",Ta na rana nipangononongan o aryarilaw na jyaten ni Ama ta do to ni Yeso Kizisto. Am ori o icyakma tey asa so onowned a manci no Amin a zomwazway si Ama ta do to. 
1238764,"Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; ",O yamapait jyamen a ka ninyo a yakomdeng so nakem ji Yeso am si Ama ta do to. Nipamnekan na yaten a lamlamsoy na. 
1238765,"who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.",So na nitorwan nya jyaten so Seyzi a omoyat do onowned ta. O Seyzi rana am tovil no kanoyong ta a monganay jya tao. Ta o Seyzi rana am akma ney yongkad no makakaday a omanam a itoro na jyaten ni Ama ta do to.
1238766,"Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. ","Ko tawagan si Ama ta do to a macingosongoso nyaken. No si mangalalas ko am cyaha, ta pasingsingkadan na yaken. Ori o to ko na manci no kaji ko nangayan do Kedinto a omwoya ninyo. Ta manakem ko o kapamlis nyo pa. "
1238767,"Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.","Beken a namen gacigatan inyo a manganoyong, ta yakamo na makdeng so nakem ji Ama ta do to. So namen kagagan ninyo a pacivazayan do namen kapasaray jinyo."
1238768,"But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. ",Am ori o to ko na mamneki do kaji ko na ratan so kangangay nyo no si mangay ko pa jinyo no ipisa. 
1238769,"For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? ",No si yaken yaomrahet so aktokto nyo am sino pa o ipeyhanhan ko a mapasaray jyaken. Inyo saon o mapasaray jyaken. 
1238770,"And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. ","Am ori an o ko nipeyteygamyan ninyo, ta maraherahet o karahet nyo so aktokto no si makaranes ko jinyo. Ta yako ipeyhanhan inyo a yamapasaray jyaken no si mangay ko jinyo do dang. Ta ko anoyngan o sarasaray ko a sarasaray nyoo. "
1238771,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.","To ko meykaoo a meyngen so onowned no kapeyteygami ko ninyo. Am beken a irahet ko so onowned nyo, ta ipakateneng nyo jyaken a tey marilaw ninyo."
1238772,"But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. ",No myan so tao a amrahet so aktokto no karwan no tao am beken a yakehen o raheten na so aktokto. Ta mamimin kamo a ko peycirngan sya. Am beken a ipasnesnek ta so nimapeyvazay so akman sang a tao. 
1238773,"Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. ",Ta ikananao na rana o oyaoyyan da nya no aro a tao. 
1238774,"So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. ","Inyo rana am to nyo peykabobwa, apwapwen nyo o akman sang a tao an. Ta marahet o katey meyngen na so onowned. "
1238775,Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. ,Am ori an o ko kakzeban jinyo amnanao sya a kapakateneng na rana jinyo a marilaw nya. 
1238776,"For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. ","O peypeypangayan no mina teygami ko jinyo asyo am iskad ko do nakenakem nyo. Ta manngo paro sira, panoden da o nakem da jyaken an? "
1238777,"To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; ",O peykabobwen nyo so marahet a vazay a tao am to ko macyanod so nakem jinyo. Ta o ikakman ko sang am peyyanowanopen ko inyo so nakem do tangain ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1238778,lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.,Ta maraherahet o kakata na ni Satan. Ta yabo jyaten o yaji makateneng do ipanlilita ni Satan.
1238779,"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, ",No kangay ko do Teloya ili a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Yeso Kizisto am niwangan na rana ni Yeso o angayan ko peyvazayan. 
1238780,"I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. ","Am ko marahet so aktokto, ta ji ko nimasinmo si Tito a akma tey kakteh do cinai. Am ori o to ko naitaiji so tao do dang a kangay ko na do Maciton."
1238781,"Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.","Am yako isaray ji Ama ta do to, ta yata na macikaop ji Yeso Kizisto. Ta na niharag rana ni Yeso Kizisto o raraten. So ta ikanoyong rana a macizanod ji Kizisto a nimakata. So da ipakateneng rana ji Yeso no tao, do ta kalivolivon no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Kizisto. "
1238782,"For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: ","Tamo akman rana si Yeso Kizisto a na isaray ni Ama ta do to, do ta kapeylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na do omanoyong jya tao a kano ji nganoyong jya tao. "
1238783,to the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? ,"Am o ji nganoyong jya tao am ikaoya da o akman sang a ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to, do kangay na jira no peyoyaoyyan ni Ama ta do to no makwa. Am omanoyong jya tao am ikavyay no pahad da. Sino makapeyvazay so akman sang a rako a vazay. "
1238784,"For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.",Namen jyakman so aro a tao a yamacininizpi no nanao ni Ama ta do to. Ta namen meyngongyod a nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to a yameylimwang no ciriciring na. So namen ikanoyong a yaji mangalalas so ciring a lamlamsoy na ni Kizisto.
1238785,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you? ","Manngwa, namen pahamahen o aktokto namen? Manngwa, namen akman so yatatasa tao a manta ninyo so teygami a yongkad namen a lamlamsoy ni Ama ta do to? Namen ji ngakzeba inyo a meylimwang nya do tao so kazwayan namen. "
1238786,"Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: ",Ta inyo rana am akma kamoy teygami a yongkad namen a yanivatvatkan do onowned namen a vilangan da no tao. 
1238787,"forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.",Kamo mapayok a akma ney teygami ni Kizisto a yana nivatvatkan a yana niparara jyamen. O teygami rana ya am beken a yana nivatvatkan ni Ama ta do to no ipeyveyvatvatek do mataripis a vato a nitaid na ji Moyse. Ta nivatvatkan no Seyzi no to meyyonong a Tao do to do onowned no tao.
1238788,And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: ,O namen icyakman sang am si Ama ta do to o nimamnek jyamen a lamlamsoy na. So namen peyhanhanan ni Kizisto a omoyat jyamen. 
1238789,not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; ,Am beken a namen pangozayan o oyowyat namen a yamapeyvazay so sya. Ta o yakapwan no oyowyat a kano teneteneng namen a yamapeyvazay so sya am yapo ji Ama ta do to. 
1238790,"who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.",Iya o yanamen ipakahap so vayo a pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to a yanamen ipeylimwang. Oya rana am beken a nivatvatkan. Ta pangozayan a ciring no Seyzi. O nivatvatkan a iwawalam am ikawakwak no tao. Am o Seyzi am itoro na jyaten o to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta.
1238791,"But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: ",O iwawalam ni Moyse am nivatvatkan do mataripis a vato. No keyyan no nang am tomwaw rana o azwazway na ni Ama ta do to. No kanang am nimaniray o moing ni Moyse. Am ori o nikakowap da no Isedi a tao no oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to. No si manoyong a mazway o na kapwan no peyoyaoyyan ni Ama ta do to a iwawalam ni Moyse am 
1238792,how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? ,ney manngo o oyowyat no Seyzi a mapanop jyaten ji Ama ta do to. Ta jyabo kaji na azwazwayan pa kano iwawalam ni Moyse a. 
1238793,"For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. ","No manoyong o kazway no iwawalam ni Moyse a manci no raraten am arakorako pa o kazwayan na no vayo a pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to a makavonas so raraten ta, a kabo na rana no raraten ta do tangain na. "
1238794,"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. ",O vayo a pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to am na rana to meyhavasi o adan a pangozayan a ciring ni Moyse. 
1238795,"For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.",No yamanoyong keyyan no oyowyat na no yaji meyyonownay a iwawalam am jyabo kaji na rakorakwan pa no oyowyat na no yato meyyonong ori a.
1238796,"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: ",Yanamen manoyong a meyhanhan no akman sang. Am ori o yanamen jyaonibi rana a meylimwang no ciring na ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1238797,"and not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: ","Yanamen jyakman si Moyse a mangap so milakayob a ibengbeng so moing na, kaji da makacittan no Isedi a tao so maniray a moing na, do kanimeypalikey na rana no iciray na sira. "
1238798,but their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ. ,Am o onowned da am yakmey kaneban yatodangay sicyaikwaya. Ta no yada vilangan o yamakakaday a vakong do adan a Seysyo am yakman sang a yamabengbeng o onowned da. Ta o macitovong a tao ji Kizisto o ikapakaro no ombengbeng do onowned da. 
1238799,"But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. ",Yamangay sicyaikwaya o na ji iwangi no onowned da no yameyvilang do nivatvatkan ni Moyse a vakong. 
1238800,"Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.",Am no sazapen da o Panirsirngen ta am keywangan o onowned da.
1238801,"Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. ","O yana malavat do jya Panirsirngen ta am Seyzi. O yanan no Seyzi a tao am kowvayan rana o onowned na, ta italamozong na rana no Seyzi. "
1238802,"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.",Yatamo todamimin a yajyabengbengi so moing. Ta o tao rana a omonot do Panirsirngen ta Seyzi am amyan rana jira o azwazway na ni Ama ta do to a omyavayo sira. Am ori o icyakman da sya so icicirawat a tey mazway.
1238803,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; ",Yamanoyong si Ama ta do to a yamarilaw nyamen do na kapahanhan jyamen do vazay na. Ori o namen rana jyaraci nya so onowned. 
1238804,"but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. ","Namen ji ngapa o macimanig a vazay. Namen ji mangalalas. Namen ji palasa o ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to, ji powziba o nanao ni Ama ta do to. Ta ipacita namen do tao o icicirawat namen, do kanoyong namen a lamlamsoy na ni Ama ta do to. "
1238805,"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: ",No myan so ji makateneng do Mapasaray a Ciriciring a ipeylimwang namen am o ji manaralay a tao saon o ji makateneng jya. 
1238806,"in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. ","Da ji nganoyngi no tao, ta yana bengbengen ni Satan o onowned da no yaji manganoyong a tao. Am ori o da ji makatenngi do peypeypangayan no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a yaomagaz do azwazway na ni Yeso Kizisto. Ta si Yeso Kizisto rana am ta nipakacita rana si Ama ta do to. "
1238807,"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. ","Beken a kataotao namen o namen ipeylimwang, ta namen ipeylimwang si Yeso Kizisto a manoyong a Panirsirngen ta. O namen sidongan jinyo am lamlamsoy na yamen ni Yeso Kizisto. "
1238808,"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.",O nimangamaog no ciring na so zezak a Tao do to am ori o amzezak so masyonowned ta. Ori o ta ipakateneng do azwazway na ni Ama ta do to amyan ji Yeso Kizisto.
1238809,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. ","Am yamen rana am katonodan namen o nyamaog no tana vanga a maspispi. Am o maoran do onowned namen a ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am tey makdeng. So ikabeken a yamonganay jyamen no oyowyat a meylimwang nya, ta monganay ji Ama ta do to. "
1238810,"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; ",Namen masangib a makasazi so alalaw am namen ji pehmai. Tomakatakaw am namen kaji makatenngan do namen ahahapan sya am ji namen a mahayo. 
1238811,"persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; ",Yaro tao a macioya jyamen am yamyan so tao a marilaw nyamen. No to namen jyangangay so inawan a pakakasyan da am ji namen a wakwak. 
1238812,"always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. ","Namen masangib a yatoda jyangangay so inawan akman si Yeso Kizisto a nipamnekan da a limanen, do yanamen kapeylimwang ni Yeso Kizisto a yapa mavyay a Tao do to. "
1238813,"For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. ",O ikakman na sang am yamonganay ji Yeso Kizisto o yapwan no inawan namen. 
1238814,"So then death worketh in us, but life in you. ","Tana masangib namen a toda jyangangay so inawan am cyaha, ta ipakasidong namen jinyo a makahap so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad nyo."
1238815,"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; ","Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Ko anoyngan si Ama ta do to an. Am ori o ko peylimwangan nya."" Namen akman so sang a meyhanhan nya. Am ori o namen peylimwangan nya. "
1238816,"knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. ",Namen katenngan o yanimapeyvangon si Yeso a Tao do to a mapeyvangon jyamen akman si Yeso a kamimin ta na macikaop jya do teyngato. 
1238817,"For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.",Monganay jinyo o alalaw namen a ipakasidong namen jinyo a peypahagnaten so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to. So na ikanoyong no pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a itoro na do aro a tao. Am ori o ikarwaro rana no tao a zomwazway si Ama ta do to a isaray da.
1238818,"For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. ","Am ori an, namen jyaraci nya so onowned. Tana ji namen a ngahay a yameypararakeh am yamangday do araraw o onowned namen a yameypahagnat. "
1238819,"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; ","O yaji meyyonownay a alalaw namen eya am ipakahap namen so maharahara pa, a to meyyonong a azwazway namen ji Ama ta do to. "
1238820,"while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.",Namen jyakzan o macimalag do mata namen a monganay do karawan. Ta namen ikeykakza o yajyacita no mata. Ta ori rana am ji meyyonownay ori. Am o yajyacita no mata am to meyyonong ori.
1238821,"For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. ","Tamo katenngan o na kakmey vahay no kataotao ta do karawan eya a mababalinas. Am no makwa am ipanta na yaten so asa ka vayo a kataotao ta do teyngato ni Ama ta do to. Am beken a nyamaog no tao, ta nyamaog ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o to na meyyonongi. "
1238822,"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: ",Tana tamo macizizikna sicyaikwaya yatoda ji nalap a yamangay a meyvahay do teyngato am 
1238823,if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. ,"no marateng o araraw no kapanta na nyaten so vayo a kataotao ta am beken a todaveyvow a pahad ta, ta macyangay dang o vayo a kataotao ta. "
1238824,"For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. ","O kataotao ta ya akma tey vahay do karawan eya am yamakahap so alalaw ta do karawan. So to ta ji ngamogi so kangay ta do teyngato, do na katey yaro no alalaw ta do teyrahem. So ikanoyong na rana no maliman a kataotao ta ya alitan na rana no vayo a itoro na ni Ama ta do to a to meyyonong a kataotao ta. "
1238825,"Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.",Ta isonong na yaten ni Ama ta do to a somazap so akman sang a yeyyak ta no mata. O yongkad no nang am Seyzi a na nitoro jyaten.
1238826,"Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: ","Am ori an, yaten rana a meyhanhan ni Yeso Kizisto a tao am ji tamo a ratan no onowned no amyan so alalaw ta an. Ta tamo katenngan no mavyay pa o kataotao ta am marai pa o kapacikaop ta ji Yeso do teyngato. "
1238827,"(for we walk by faith, not by sight:) ",Tana ta jyacita no mata ta si Ama ta do to am ta ipeyhanhan sicyaikwaya a mangononong do ciriciring na. 
1238828,"we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. ",So ikanoyong ta rana jyavokahaw a toda ji ngamaog so kataotao ta do karawan a mangay a macitovong ji Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. 
1238829,"Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. ",Tana kataotao ta do teyrahem am tana monganay rana o kataotao ta do teyngato am ney makdeng na am ji ta hamangi o kapasaray ta si Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. 
1238830,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.",Ta mamimin tamo eya a mangay do tangain ni Yeso Kizisto a pacicin na. To na palololwa do mina vazay ta do karawan o itoro na jyaten.
1238831,"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. ",Namen katenngan o kapeypanam no kapacici na jyaten ni Ama ta do to. Am ori o namen vavagan do tao a amraralay ni Ama ta do to. Ta yana katenngan o onowned namen ni Ama ta do to. Inaoy si akman kamo sang a makateneng do onowned namen. 
1238832,"For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. ",Beken a namen pazwain o kataotao namen jinyo. Ta namen kakzeben inyo a zomwazway so mina vazay namen do tao. Ta ori o itovis nyo do mapakazwazway no kapya da a ji macipayok so onowned ji Ama ta do to. 
1238833,"For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. ","Tana ipanci da yamen no tao a meylamraw am cyaha, ji namen rata ori an, do namen kahap so vazay ni Ama ta do to. Am no si katenngan namen o apya kano marahet am cyaha, ta ipeypapya nyo. "
1238834,"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: ",O pangangarilawan ni Kizisto amyan do onowned namen. Ta namen katenngan sicyaikwaya o kanimawakwak ni Yeso no tao do karawan. Am ori o ta icyakmey asa rana a macizanod do inawan ni Yeso a nimawakwak. 
1238835,"and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.",Na nikawakwak ni Yeso o tao do karawan. Ori o ji ta to mangozai do aktokto ta. Ta pangozayan ta si Yeso Kizisto a nimawakwak no raraten ta a kapirwa na rana mavyay.
1238836,"Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. ","Am ori o ji ta to mangozai do ahahapan ta sya a tomita so icyatatao ta. Tana akman so sang o nyahahapan ta si Kizisto no kakwa am cyaha, ta tamo na niblisan sicyaikwaya. "
1238837,"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. ",Ta o macikaop ji Yeso Kizisto a tao am vayo rana o onowned na. Ta nipeymakarwan na rana o adan a icicirawat na. So ikamimin na rana vayo. 
1238838,"And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; ",O akman rana sang am mamimin ori a vazay na ni Ama ta do to. Si Yeso Kizisto am ori o tanyo ipacikaop rana ji Ama ta do to a mina kavosoyan na. So ta icyakman sang a ipeyhanhan ni Ama ta do to a mangay a mapanop so ji manaralay a tao ji Ama ta do to. 
1238839,"to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.",O yanamen ipeylimwang a ciriciring eya am na nipangozayan si Yeso ni Ama ta do to a yamapanop jyaten a tao do karawan. Na ji nita o raraten no tao. So na torwan nya jyamen so nanao na a meylimwang nya do tao a kanop da rana si Ama ta do to.
1238840,"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. ",Lamlamsoy na yamen ni Kizisto.

1238845,"But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, ","Yamen rana do yamakakaday a vazay am yanamen akmey tongbowa o yameykamadadayan a alalaw, do namen kanoyong a lamlamsoy ni Ama ta do to. "

1238857,"And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. ","Ji nyo peyzavoza o raralayan nyo ni Ama ta do to a kano malas a iraralay da no tao. Ta yaten o na yanan no to meyyonong a Tao do to. Akman so ipanci na do Seysyo.

1238860,"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.","Am ori an manga kakteh an, no yamanoyong o akman sang a nakem na jyaten ni Ama ta do to am apzatan ta o onowned ta an.

1238861,"Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. ",Inarahen nyo yamen so nakenakem jinyo an. Ta abo namen nirahet no kangangay do kadwan jyaten. Yabwata asa ka tao namen nilittan no ciring namen. 
1238862,"I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you. ",O ko peycirngan so sang am beken a ko patwawen o nyo karatan. Ta nipanci ko na jinyo namen karilaw ninyo. Tana mavyay namen a tana mawakwak namen am abo makapeysyay jyaten so nakenakem. 
1238863,"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.",Yako ipeyhanhan inyo. Yako azwain inyo. Tana amyan so aro a alalaw ko am ko jyanyaheyan. Ta yako ipeyhanhan inyo a mapadnadna so nakem ko.
1238864,"For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. ","Ta makaranes namen do Maciton am ji namen nimeywalam. Ta ji namen angned so ninyakan, do katey yaro no alalaw namen do peycyeylilyan na do kazyakan da nyamen a kapaciyoman na pa no kasinalaw namen ninyo a mablis so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to. "
1238865,"Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; ",Am si Ama ta do to a marilaw no makasi a tao am ori nisomidong jyamen a yanitomovoy si Tito a yamapait jyamen. 
1238866,"and not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. ","Beken a na kai do jya an. Ta aro o ciring na a nipanci na jyamen do kanimapait nyo sya a kapanci nyo no kakzan nyo nyaken a macita, keyngen nyo so onowned a makanakem so marahet a vazay nyo no kakwa. So nyo ikanoyong a mahap so vazay ko. Ori o ko sarayan no akman sang jinyo."
1238867,"For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season. ",O mina teygami ko jinyo no kakwa am tana nikazabab nyo so onowned am ko ji nimaneseh. Am manakenakem ko am jyabo kaji nyo mazababan so onowned no mina ciring ko jinyo do teygami ko a. Am ori o icyakma koy maneneseh. 
1238868,"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. ",Am ko na masaray sicyaikwaya. Am beken a ko isaray o kanimazabab nyo nyaken so onowned. Ta o lavyan nyo am nyo nikablis so onowned. Ta nakenakem na ori ni Ama ta do to. So nikapya no vazay namen jinyo. 
1238869,For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. ,Ta o omlavi a mamlis do peyraratenan da am niblis na ni Ama ta do to so onowned da a ipeypapya da. Am o monganay do karawan a ilavi no onowned da no ji makanakem si Ama ta do to am ipeykaraherahet da. 
1238870,"For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. ",Cittey kamo pala. Ta si Ama ta do to rana am na nipeypapya jinyo o lavyan nyo a meypakdeng so nakenakem jya. Ta nyo nikaoya rana o mina raraten nyo. Nyo nikaoya o peyraratenan na no asa ka tao ang. Ta nyo ji mya o kapacizagom nyo jya a peydednan no oyaoyyan na nya ni Ama ta do to. O akman rana sang a onowned nyo sicyaikwaya am yongkad na rana no kanoyong nyo nimamlis rana so onowned. 
1238871,"Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.",O ko nivatvatkan do teygami ori am ko ivavaga do meyraraten a tao a kano ji na panadnada tao. Am o ney makdeng a peypeypangayan na pa no mina teygami ko jinyo am ko patwawen o apya nakenakem nyo jyamen do tangain ni Ama ta do to. 
1238872,"Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. ","Ori rana o nikait jyamen an. Am beken a orii an, ta o sarasaray ni Tito am ori o yanamen isaray. Ta nimamimin kamo a nisomidong sya. So na ikasaray. "
1238873,"For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth. ",Tana nyazwazway ko ninyo do tangain ni Tito am abo kalasan na no nang. Ta o mina ciring namen a pagazen namen jinyo am yamamimin a manoyong ori. So namen pacyanoyngan do namen pazwain do tangain ni Tito a yamanoyong. 
1238874,"And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. ","Am no na manakem inyo a aro a tao a yaomanoyong ji Ama ta do to am yakmey to ngyan jinyo o onowned na, do nyo kapeyveyveken sya. "
1238875,I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.,Ko tey masaray sicyaikwaya do ko kapeyhanhan rana ninyo.
1238876,"Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; ","Manga kakteh ko do cinai, inaoy no si katenngan nyo o aryarilaw na ni Ama ta do to do peycyakyokyokayan na do Maciton. "
1238877,how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. ,Tana tey makdeng o nilamdaman na sira ni Ama ta do to am sira na to naray. Tana mavak o velek da am da makto o da kapeykingking so da ipanidong. 
1238878,"For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; ",Ko na ji naywa o ciring ko am o kingking da am yarwaro rana kano yada makazamo do kataotao da a da nakem si Ama ta do to. 
1238879,"praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. ",Ta da to meynakman o da kai jyamen a manci no kasidong da so akma dey kakteh do cinai a sinjya do Yotay. 
1238880,"And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. ",Namen jyaktoktwan o vazay da a yatey yaro. Ta sira rana am da nipeykingking ji Ama ta do to o kataotao da a mahap so vazay na a yaomamizing so ciring namen.
1238881,"Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. ",Am ori o namen kakzeban si Tito a to ngyan jinyo do dang a somidong jinyo a mapakavos so nipamnekan nyo a vazay a marilaw no akma nyoy kakteh do cinai. 
1238882,"Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.",O yamakakaday a yamyan jinyo a nakenakem nyo si Ama ta do to a kano teneteneng nyo a mangononong a kano kowyowyat nyo a manidong so tao a kano aryarilaw nyo jyamen am yateywara rana an. Am ori o namen kakzan inyo a yajingbeywan do akman sya panidongan so tao.
1238883,"I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. ",Am beken a ko gacigatan inyo a mapeyvazay sya. Ta ko ipaziman jinyo o kakdekdeng da no sinjya do Maciton a somkad do kanoyong na kalas na no pangangarilawan nyo so icyatatao nyo. 
1238884,"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. ",Nyo na katenngan o pangangasyan ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. Iya rana am abwata o kakzeben na an. Ta iya rana am tey meynakem do teyngato. Am na kapanadnad jyaten. So na ikakmey makasi a tao. Na apyapyahen pa o na katoda katawwan a yamapazanod jyaten do azwazway na do teyngato.
1238885,"And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. ",Ko naknakmen o akman sang a vazay am apyapya rana o kapakavos nyo sicyaikwaya so nipeysinsinmo nyo no kaminasawan a ipanidong nyo so tao. Ta nimanma kamo a nimapeyvazay so akman sya. So ika inyo no mapeynakem so akman sya. 
1238886,"Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have. ",Am ori o ji nyo pahephepi jya a pakavosen. Ta inarahen nyo o kakdekdeng nyo no kavayo nyo pa mapeysinsinmo sya. Am to nyo mangozai o myan jinyo. 
1238887,"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. ","No si manoyong kamo so onowned no meykingking kamo am jyabo kaji na narayan ninyo ni Ama ta do to a. Ta o kakzeben na jinyo ni Ama ta do to am beken a karo na, ta o myamyan jinyo. "
1238888,"For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality: ","Beken a ko ziknahen inyo a somidong so makasi a tao. No kamo manoyong a yamabsoy sicyaikwaya am sidongen nyo sira yamakcin a tao. Cyaha, ta no mabsoy sira am sidongen da inyo no makcin kamo. So ikanoyong nyo a macisidosidong do alalaw nyo. Beken a ko ziknahen inyo a somidong so makasi a tao. No kamo manoyong a yamabsoy sicyaikwaya am sidongen nyo sira yamakcin a tao. Cyaha, ta no mabsoy sira am sidongen da inyo no makcin kamo. So ikanoyong nyo a macisidosidong do alalaw nyo. "
1238889,"as it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.","Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""O aro so nimahap am abo dang o mapanpan. O apereh so nimahap am todey macinet."""
1238890,"But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. ","Namen isaray ji Ama ta do to, ta na nipait si Tito. So na icyakman jyamen a yamakdeng a yasomidong jinyo. "
1238891,"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. ","Beken a na kamizing so ciring namen, ta yamonganay jya yamakza no na kangay jinyo do dang. "
1238892,"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; ",Namen manovoy so yasa ka tao a macihza jya. Iya rana am da ikanig no tao do peycyakyokyokayan na a yameylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1238893,"and not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind: ","Beken a ori an, ta iya rana am da nitenngan no peycyakyokyokayan na yamacilivon jyamen a mapeyvazay so pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to. O namen ahapan so akman sya vazay am yatomngeh do azwazway ni Ama ta do to a ipakateneng da jyamen a meyngongyod so nakenakem a mangarilaw so tao."
1238894,"avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: ",Namen apzatan o onowned namen a yatomalamozong no aro a nizpi. Ta maraherahet o kazyak da nyamen no aro a tao. 
1238895,"providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. ",Beken a do tangain ni Ama ta do to o kapya namen so icicirawat. Ta akman sang do tangain no tao.
1238896,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. ",Am ori o namen ipanovoy so yasa ka mahakay a macihza jira. Iya rana am namen masangib rana yaileylamdamen so onowned. Am ori o namen pakatenngan jya a tey makdeng a yamanidong so tao. Am ori o na ikasaray so onowned a yasomidong jinyo. 
1238897,"Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ. ",Si Tito rana am kararay ko ya a yasomidong jinyo. O yamacihza jya rarwa ka mahakay am nitenngan da no peycyakyokyokayan na. So ikanoyong da pacikazwayan ni Kizisto. 
1238898,"Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.",Taotawwen nyo sira a kamimin da no aro a kyokay a makateneng do akman sang a pangarilawan nyo a kaji da palasan so nyazwazwayan namen jinyo.
1238899,"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: ",O vazay rana do sidongan ta so sinjya do Yotay am tana ji ko na meyteygami jinyo. 
1238900,"for I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many. ","Am cyaha, ta ko katenngan o na kajya salitan jinyo. Ta nyazwazway ko inyo do tao do Maciton, do kanimapapo nyo sya no kaminasawan so kasidong nyo sira. So da peyzokaban inyo a tao do Sila a yatey makdeng a yamanidong so tao. "
1238901,"Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: ",So ko tovoyan si Tito a kano rarwa a akma tey kakteh do cinai a mangay jinyo do dang. Inaoy si mangononong o ciring ko do kanoyong na rana no kingking nyo amyan rana. So ipacimangno na no namen azwazwayan jinyo. 
1238902,"lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. ",No si myan so tao do Maciton a macihza jyamen a mangay a kapakateneng da do kingking nyo abo am jyabo kaji namen anigan a. So ikakman nyo sang a manig an. 
1238903,"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.",Am ori an o ikapyapya pa no kapanovoy ko pala sira a manmanma a mangay jinyo do dang a amlovot so nipanci nyo a kingking nyo no kakwa pa. Inaoy no si manoyong rana myan no si makaranes ko na jinyo dang. Ta ori o pakatovilan da jinyo a masaray a manidong so tao.
1238904,"But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. ",Manakem nyo an. Ta o apereh so nipamowa am apereh o mahap da. O aro so nipamowa am aro mahap da. 
1238905,"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. ","Am to nyo palololwa o kingking nyo do onowned nyo. Ji nyo manenesehan, ta makto nyo an. Ta isaray na ni Ama ta do to o masaray so onowned a meykingking jya tao. "
1238906,"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: ",Ta arakorako pa o itoro na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. So ikanoyong nyo to meypanpan do kanekanen nyo a manidong so ikeykasi nyo a tao. 
1238907,"(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: His righteousness remaineth for ever.","Akman so ciring do Seysyo. Maniring am, ""O manidong so makasi a tao am peyyanen na ni Ama ta do to do onowned na a mangay no makwa."""
1238908,"Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;) ","Si Ama ta do to am yapwan no mowahen da kano kanen da. Akman sang an, ta anoyngan nyo si Ama ta do to a manta ninyo so makakaday a ipanidong nyo so tao. So ikakman nyo so kayo so pangangarilawan a mapka no asi na. "
1238909,"being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. ",Absoin na inyo an. So ikasangib nyo a manidong so tao an. So sarayan da nya ji Ama ta do to so apo jinyo a nisidong nyo sira. 
1238910,"For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; ",Ta o kingking nyo am yamanoyong yamakasidong so sinjya. So ikanoyong da no aro a tao a somaray nya ji Ama ta do to. 
1238911,"whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; ",O akman rana sang a ipanidong nyo so tao am ipakateneng da jinyo no aro a tao a yaomonot ji Kizisto a yaji mapasala do nanao ni Kizisto a yamanidong so tao. Am ori o da miminan so azwazway a itoro ji Ama ta do to no aro a tao. 
1238912,"and by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you. ","So da ikakdeng no tao a yameyneynozi ninyo, do da kapakacita so aryarilaw na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. "
1238913,Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.,"Isaray ta ji Ama ta do to, do na kateywara no pangangarilawan na a yana nitoro jyaten!"
1238914,"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: ","Yaken rana am si Pawlo ko a yamvavaga jinyo. No kamo maniring am, ""Ka apiya so ciring no ka macikaop jyamen. No ka ji macikaop jyamen am mo ji ngeypeypepzaci yamen do teygami mo,"" kwan nyo yaken. Am sicyaikwa rana ya am ko na hapen o kapyapya na ni Kizisto a yamapasyasi jinyo. "
1238915,"but I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. ","Ji nyo ngakzeba o kanig ko ninyo no si mai ko an. Ta jyabo kanig ko no yatomamwad jyamen a, a yamanci no namen kapazway so aktokto namen. "
1238916,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: ",Tana namen macizavoz do tao do karawan am o namen ipacirawarawa am beken a yamonganay do karawan. 
1238917,"(for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) ",Ta o voovoo namen am beken a yamonganay do oyowyat a kano teneteneng do karawan. Ta o oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to o voovoo namen a yato manbalinas so vazay ni Satan a yamangalalas so tao. 
1238918,"casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; ",Namen pahawahen so makakaday a mapazway a ciriciring a kano malas a nakenakem a yada izazat do tao a makateneng ji Ama ta do to. So namen pangozayan do oyowyat ni Ama ta do to a yamapanod so ji manaralay a tao ji Kizisto. 
1238919,"and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled. ",No si manoyong o kanod nyo rana ji Ama ta do to am ioya namen sira o ji ngonot a tao.
1238920,"Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's. ",O vazay no tao o macita nyo. Am nyo jyacita o onowned no tao. No si amyan so tao a manci no katalamozong na ni Ama ta do to am manakenakem pa an. Ta beken a iyaha o yamonganay ji Kizisto. Ta namen akman sang a yamonganay ji Kizisto. 
1238921,"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: ","O na nitoro jyamen ni Yeso Kizisto a vazay namen am namen sidongen inyo. Beken a namen ipeyparaherahet inyo. Am ori an, tana teywara o pazwayan namen so vazay namen am jyabo kanig namen a. "
1238922,that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. ,Ji nyo mancyan o kangangamo ko jinyo no ciring ko do teygami an. 
1238923,"For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible. ","Yamyan so tao a yamapeyciring so, ""No yameyvatvatek si Pawlo am tana yamangdet pa, yajyowyat am. Am no yana to macimata eya am malma, yabo so oyowyat a yamarahet so ipanirisiring."" "
1238924,"Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present. ","O mapeyciring sya a tao am naknakmen da an, no kabo namen an. Ikongo ciring namen do teygami. Jyabo namen kapacitarek so yanamen ahahapan sya do namen yai rana."
1238925,"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. ","Namen jyadkeci namen kapazanod so kataotao namen do yamapakarakarang so kataotao da. Ta yamanoyong da kakmey ji makownong jya an, a yamapehngay so kataotao da do kadwan jira. "
1238926,"But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. ",Jyabo na kateywara no namen pazwayan so kataotao namen. Ta o vazay namen ji Ama ta do to na pamindan. So na nipaminda jinyo no vazay namen a namen pazwain. 
1238927,"For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ: ","No manoyong na kapaminda jinyo am yajyalas o na kaji meyhavasan no ciring ni Kizisto a yanamen ipamizing jinyo, do kaney manma namen a yameylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Kizisto jinyo. "
1238928,"not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, ","O yanamen jya nimatokod rana a ili am namen jyadkeci a yapazwain a manci no kanimapeyvazay namen sya. Am namen isaray o kapeypahagnat no onowned nyo. Ta ori o karakorako na pa no vazay namen jinyo, "
1238929,"to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand. ",a yangay namen pa do peycyeylilyan na a peylimwangan no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. So ji namen mapazwai so nipakavos da vazay no tao a kazwayan namen. 
1238930,"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. ","Akman so ciring do Seysyo. Maniring am, ""O mapazway a tao am apyapya o kapazway na so vazay na ni Ama ta do to a Panirsirngen ta."""
1238931,"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.",Ta o ipanci na ni Ama ta do to apya so vazay am ori o manoyong a azwazwain. Ta o mapazway so kataotao na am ji na narayan ni Ama ta do to o akman sang.
1238932,Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me. ,Tana ji ko a teneteneng am amizngen nyo pa yaken an. 
1238933,"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. ",Yaken rana am yako pangozayan o pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a yamarilaw ninyo. Kamo akman so jya nimacivahavahay a mavakes a yako tovoin a someksek ji Kizisto. 
1238934,"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. ","Am yako ikanyahey o kapeyparahet no onowned nyo a todahamang rana ji Yeso Kizisto, akman si Iwa a nilittan no volay. "
1238935,"For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. ",Ikeykongo kamo a yato mamyapya no yamacitarek so ipeylimwang a ka nyamen a yaomagaz ji Yeso. Ikeykongo kamo eya a to nganoyong do macitarek so ipeylimwang a Seyzi a kano Mapasaray a Ciriciring. 
1238936,For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. ,Ko ji nganoyngi o ko katonton do yamangalalas a beken a lamlamsoy ni Kizisto. 
1238937,"But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.",Tana ko jyateneteneng a meyzezyak am jyabo katonton ko so teneteneng jira mangalalas a tao. So yako ikasangib a yamapacita no akman sang a vazay jinyo.
1238938,"Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? ","No ko pamizngen inyo no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am yabwata asa ka apzapzatan a yako nyami jinyo. Ko to pakabowa o kataotao ko, do ko kapyapya pa jinyo a meypahagnat so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to. Manngwa, ko kalasan o akman sang? "
1238939,"I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service. ",No kapeyvazay ko pa jinyo do dang am patodahan da yaken no tatasa ka kyokay. So yako icyakmey jyaninig no kyokay ori a yako peylamsoin a yasomidong jinyo. 
1238940,"And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself. ",No keyyan ko pa jinyo do dang am tana amyan so ikeykakza ko am ji ko pa nimapasyasi jinyo. So ikamimin na apo do akma koy kakteh do cinai do Maciton no mapatodeh jyaken. Tana no kakwa am tana no makwa am akman sang. Jyabo kapamyapya ko no kataotao ko a ikazikna nyo a. 
1238941,"As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. ",Abo malas a ciring ni Yeso. So icyakman ko sang a jyalas so ciring jinyo. Am ori o ko jyamoi a manci nya do pongso no Sila so kakman ko sang a ji ngakday so patodahen da jyaken. 
1238942,Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.,"Ikongo ko peycirngan sang. Manngwa, ko jyarilawan inyo? Cyaha, ta na katenngan ni Ama ta do to o ko karilawan ninyo."
1238943,"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. ","So ji ko mirwai do akman sang a nakenakem ko a mahap so patodahen nyo jyaken. Ta izavat ko so pazwayan da so ciring da no mangalalas a beken a lamlamsoy ni Kizisto, do kabo no pacicingayan no vazay da jyamen. "
1238944,"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. ",Sira rana mangalalas a tao am beken a meyngongyod sira a lamlamsoy ni Kizisto. Ta sira ji macipayok so icicirawat. 
1238945,And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. ,Am jyabo kazyak no akman sang a. Ta kakwakwan ni Satan a mapatpetpeh akmey maniray a tinsi ni Ama ta do to. 
1238946,Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.,Am ori o ji ta ngyaki no mangalalas a tao a peylamsoin ni Satan a akmey apiya so ciring. Ta to rana tenngi o pangavosan no vazay da no akman sang a tao pasingsingtan na ni Ama ta do to.
1238947,"I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. ",So ko olyan pa sya ipanci. Jyabo kapasagsagpyan da jyaken no tao a. Tana pasagsagpyanen nyo yaken am amizngen nyo yaken an a mapazway so aliket a vazay. 
1238948,"That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. ",O ciring ko na sicyaikwaya am beken a si Yeso Kizisto o yamapahanhan jyaken a yamanci nya. Ta monganay jyaken a mapazway so kataotao ko. 
1238949,"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. ",Am da katey yaro no tao a mapazway so monganay jira vazay. Ori o ko ikakman sahang. 
1238950,"For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. ",Inyo rana am kamo todamimin a yamateteneng a tao. Am ikeykongo kamo eya to mamyapya no jyapsepsek so onowned a tao! 
1238951,"For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. ",Ta no peylamsoin da inyo am littan da inyo am soziban da inyo am ji da ninigan inyo am somiplang so posngi nyo am nyo to macyozai sira. 
1238952,"I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly, ) I am bold also. ",Ji ko nasnek a manci nya jinyo am o akman rana sang a vazay am namen jyadkeci a peyvazain. Am no myan so tao a mapazway so vazay da am to ko na mancyan o kateneng ko a mapazway. 
1238953,Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. ,No si Sipolay a tao sira am Sipolay ko an. No si Isedi a tao sira am Isedi ko an. No si apwapo na sira ni Apolahan am apo na yaken an. 
1238954,"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. ","No si lamlamsoy na sira ni Kizisto am ji ko pazway a ciring ko am jyabo kaji ko a haraharan pa ka nira. Ta yarakorako o zikzikna ko so vazay na ni Ama ta do to. Yako ipiro a da aptengen, yada bakbakan, kaji ko angayan no inawan. "
1238955,Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. ,Ipeylima ko a bakbakan da no tao do Yotay. No sipzotan da yaken am asyam o kasikapat na (39) no karwaro na no ibakbak da jyaken. 
1238956,"Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; ",Ipitlo da yaken a bakbakan no sisipzot no tao do Loma. Ipisa da yaken no tao a nigsahan. Ipitlo ko a apwaro do karakwan no awa. Ipisa ko a kasaraw a kano kasahep do karakwan no awa a to meyyawawat. 
1238957,"in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; ","No kalivon ko am apokwaro no kapeykaranom na, apokwaro do marahet so nakenakem a tao, pacyangayan no alalaw ko do tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay a kano alalaw ko do rako a ili da no aro a tao a kano alalaw ko do kabwan no nihakawan no tao a kano alalaw ko do karakwan no awa, a kapacyangay no alalaw ko do ji meyngongyod a akma koy kakteh do cinai. "
1238958,"in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. ","Jingwan sang am masangib ko a ji makaitkeh do katey mazikna ko no kataotao. No makcin ko, mawaw ko, abo isanan ko, mahen ko am akman sira sang o ikarahet ko. "
1238959,"Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. ","Beken a ori an, ta akma koy malpid no kataotao no masagpaw a rara ko, do kaji ko angnedan no ninyakan a makanakem so peycyakyokyokayan na. "
1238960,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? ",Ta sino ji ko ingenen no onowned a malma so onowned. Sino ji ko a zababan so onowned a meyraraten a tao.
1238961,"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. ",Si zowain ko o kataotao ko am apyapya pa kapazway ko so makakaday a alalaw ko. 
1238962,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. ",Si Ama ta do to a Ama na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta o makateneng jyaken a ji mangalalas. Iya o manoyong a azwazwain ta so ngaran mangay do kaidan no karawan. 
1238963,"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: ",No keyyan ko pa do Tamaseke am o kalamsoyan no panirsirngen a meyngaran so Aleta am nitovoy na o pamzaten da do ngoso no ili da amrakep jyaken. 
1238964,"and through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.",Am keyyan no sinjya a nitomonton jyaken no kolili do yala a pakasen do pazevngen no makarang a atoy no ahad no ili da. Ori o nipakasaway ko. So ji na nimakarakepi jyaken.
1238965,It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. ,Abwata kapyapyan no mapazway. Am na keyyan pa no yalikey yako pazwain. Sicyaikwaya am ko malavat o nitoro na jyaken ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta a akmey tatateynep a nimacita ko. 
1238966,"I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. ","Ko katenngan o keyyan no yasa ka sinjya a mina kapat so icyarwa (14) so awan a nikatkat na do teyngato ni Ama ta do to. Am ko jyatenngi kanimangay na no kataotao na, ta ala pahad na nimangay do teyngato. "
1238967,"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) ","So ko olyan sya ipanci. O tao rana ori am nimangay do kapyapyan. Am ko jyatenngi kanimangay na no kataotao na, ta ala pahad na nimangay do teyngato. So ko ji makatenngi jya, ta si Ama ta do to yamakateneng jya. "
1238968,"how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. ",Amyan do dang am makamizing ori so ji na mya a ipeycicici a vazay ni Ama ta do to. Ori rana am jyatenngi a ononongan a vazay. 
1238969,"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities. ",O akman rana sang a tao am ko pazwain. Am yaken rana am yabo ko pazwain do kataotao ko. Ta o yamakakaday a alalaw ko am ori o yako pazwain. 
1238970,"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me. ","Am no si manoyong o kapazway ko so kataotao ko am abo karatan no nang. Ta abo na kalalasan no ciriciring ko. Am ko kaji mapazwayan. Ta ko jyakzan o da kazwazway jyaken no tao, do kabo no teywara nimacita da, nimamizing da a monganay jyaken."
1238971,"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. ",Ta maraherahet o kazway ko so teywara a nimacita ko a vazay do teyngato. So na iyan do kataotao ko no ko maliliw a akma ney bakbakan jyaken ni Satan. Ori o ko ji makadkeci do ko kapazway so kataotao ko. 
1238972,"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. ",Yako ipitlo a yamapasyasi ji Yeso a Panirsirngen ta a mapakaro so akman sang a ingingnen ko. 
1238973,"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. ","O na nitovis jyaken am, ""Cyaha, ta yarakorako rana o aryarilaw ko jimo. Ta ko mangay oyatan imo no abo oyowyat mo."" Ori an o ko apyapyan pa so ko kapazway so oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to do kataotao ko. Ta nioyatan na yaken no kabo no oyowyat ko. "
1238974,"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.","Am ori an, ko na to meyhanhanan si Kizisto. So ji ko a raci nya no kangangay no yabo oyowyat ko, da avain yaken, no myan so rako a alalaw ko a kano peyrarehtan da jyaken do kahap ko so vazay ni Kizisto. Ta no abo oyowyat ko am na oyatan yaken ni Kizisto."
1238975,"I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing. ",Yako akmey mapazway a tao. Am monganay jinyo o yako ikakman sang a yaji mapazway jyaken do tangain no malas a tao. Tana abo angangayan ko am jyabo kaji ko maciktwan do yamangalalas a beken a lamlamsoy ni Kizisto a. 
1238976,"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. ","No keyyan ko pa jinyo do dang am tana masaod ko o alalaw ko am ji ko macimazai o vazay ko. So iyan no yeyyak nyo a vazay, yeyyak nyo a oyowyat, mapeyzokab a vazay akmey yongkad ko jinyo do kanoyong ko a nipamnekan ni Kizisto a omlivolivon no ciriciring na. "
1238977,"For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong. ",Yabo nyo pacinasan do peycyakyokyokayan na. O ko kaji mangapan so nyo nipatodeh jyaken. So to nyo peykaboboi so kalasan ko a jya nimahap so patodahen nyo jyaken!
1238978,"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. ",Ko naknakmen o ko keypitlo a mangay a tomazogaw ninyo. Am yabo ko kakzeben jinyo. Ko kakzeben am inyo. Beken a nizpi. Ta o kanakan am beken allamen da o inyapwan da. Ta o inyapwan am ori o amlam so ananak da. 
1238979,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. ","Ko ikakza inyo a sidongen an. So ikapyapya na pa no kangay no inawan ko a kapakasidong ko so pahad nyo. Manngwa, ipeyparahet nyo so nakem jyaken o karilaw ko ninyo?"
1238980,"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile. ",Yabo nyo kalalasan do kaji ko nimziknan jinyo. Am na keyyan no tao a yamanci no ko kapamizing jinyo no yamalas a yamahap so nizpi nyo. 
1238981,Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? ,"Manngwa, manoyong o kanimapasonson ko so tao a amlita jinyo an? "
1238982,"I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?",Nipanci ko si Tito a mangay a tomazogaw ninyo. So nipanovoy ko so tao a macihza jya a mangay. Am nilittan na inyo ni Tito? Jyabo na kaji macingayan jyaken so nakem a. Jyabo namen kaji meyyangangayan no namen ahahapan sya a.
1238983,"Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying. ","Ala nyo ipanci yamen a yamangamaog no kataotao namen so ciring. Am to ko na macitangayan jinyo am namen jyakman sang an. Ta o ciriciring ni Kizisto o namen ipanci jinyo do tangain ni Ama ta do to. Manga keypong, o vazay namen am namen kanakenakem so yakasidong jinyo a peypahagnaten so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to. "
1238984,"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: ","O ko ihawa si mangay ko jinyo do dang am macita ko inyo a macitarek rana so nakenakem. Macita nyo yaken a macitarek so nakem jinyo. Ko ihawa ko kapakacita so manginanahet a kano maciskaskad a kano maoyaoyahen a kano mabayo a kano manamwad a kano mangamizing so ciring do palawawan, mapazway a kano mapeyvonag so tao. "
1238985,"and lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.",Ko ihawa o kapacimasesnek ko ninyo do tangain ni Ama ta do to no ipisa mangay ko jinyo. Jyabo kaji ko lavyan a makacita so aro a somagpyan a kano mangzakza no kakwa pa a ji mamlis so nakem a tao a.
1238986,This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. ,"Ikeypitlo ko na ya mangay a tomita jinyo. Naknakmen nyo an. Ta taosya o kapaciraherahet nyo ano jya rarwa, tatlo o yongkad nyo a nimakacita sira. Ta ori o ikanoyong na. Ta ori rana am ciring do Seysyo. "
1238987,"I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare: ",Ko ipanci pa jinyo akman so nipaziman ko na jinyo no keypidwa ko a mai jinyo no kakwa. Am manakem nyo no kaji ko pa angayan jinyo sicyaikwaya an. Ta no ipisa mai ko am jyabo asa ka tao a makatayo do oyaoyyan ko ninyo a. 
1238988,"since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you. ",So iyan na pa no makakaday a yongkad nyo do kakma ney mapatwaw sya ni Kizisto so ciring na jyaken. So ipakacita nyo so oyowyat na ni Kizisto a meydedna do meyraraten a tao. 
1238989,"For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you. ",Tana yakmey yabo oyowyat na ni Kizisto do yada kanimapadket sya do jyojika am oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to o yanimapeyvangon sya. So namen ikakman sang akmey abo so oyowyat a yamacikaop ji Kizisto. Am no namen ioya inyo am oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to o namen pangozayan an.
1238990,"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? ","Ileylamdamen nyo pala o kataotao nyo. Manngwa, nyo pangononongan o nanao na ni Ama ta do to? Manngwa, nyo jyatenngi na keyyan ni Yeso Kizisto jinyo? No si abo am ji kamo anoyong pa a omanoyong jya. "
1238991,But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. ,Ko ipeyhanhan inyo a makateneng jyamen a manoyong a lamlamsoy ni Kizisto. 
1238992,"Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. ","Namen ipeynozi ji Ama ta do to o kaji nyo mapeyvazayan so marahet a vazay a ikaoya namen no si makaranes namen jinyo. Ta namen ikakza o kanoyong nyo rana apiya so nakenakem. Tana abo rana o vazay namen jinyo am cyaha, ta manoyong kamo na omonot ji Kizisto. "
1238993,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. ",Ta o vazay namen am kapangozay namen do manoyong a nanao a mapeypahagnat jinyo. 
1238994,"For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection. ",Tana da ipanci yamen a abo so oyowyat a omwoya ninyo a kakdeng no nakenakem nyo ji Ama ta do to am isaray namen o akman sang. O namen kakzeben am kapeypahagnat nyo so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to. 
1238995,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.",O ko peyteygamyan ninyo am ko kakzeben o kaji ko oyyan ninyo a mangozay do oyowyat na ni Kizisto no si mai ko jinyo do dang. Ta o yana nitoro ni Kizisto a oyowyat na jyaken am isidong ko jinyo. Beken a ioya ko inyo.
1238996,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. ","O ney manowji na yako ipanci jinyo manga kakteh am makowyowyat kamo pa mapeypahagnat so nakenakem nyo ji Kizisto an.

Ta jyabo kaji na macitovongan jinyo no yatey rako so pangangarilawan na kano yamanta nyaten so ikapiya ta so onowned a Tao do to ta. "
1238997,Greet one another with an holy kiss. ,Inyo rana am masicyakarilaw kamo a meyminaminasi no kadwan jinyo. 
1238998,All the saints salute you.,So da ikamimin no sinjya do jya a yameyminaminasi ninyo.
1238999,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen. The second epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi, a city of Macedonia, by Titus and Lucas.",Inaoy no si macitovong jinyo o pangangasyan ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta kano pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a kapzat na jinyo no Seyzi.
1239000,"Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) ","Yaken rana am si Pawlo ko. O yako ipeyngongyod a lamlamsoy na ni Ama ta do to am beken a tao o yaniomrara jyaken a omlivolivon no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to, ta si Yeso Kizisto a kani Ama ta do to a nimapeyvangon si Yeso Kizisto o yanitomovoy jyaken. "
1239001,"and all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: ",Yaken rana kano akma tey kakteh do cinai do jya am yanamen ipeyteygami inyo a peycyakyokyokayan na do Cyalatay. 
1239002,"grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, ",Inaoy si itoro na ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta o pangangarilawan na kano ikapiya na no onowned nyo.
1239003,"who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: ",Si Yeso Kizisto am na pahawahen yaten do raraten do karawan. Am ori o na pangozayan do nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to a mawakwak no raraten ta. 
1239004,to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.,Inaoy no azwazwain ta si Ama ta do to mangay do kaidan no karawan. Amin.
1239005,I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: ,Ko ikeyngen inyo so onowned a yato ngaro do pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a yanimamnek jinyo a nyo kahap so yamalas a nanao. 
1239006,"which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. ",Am to ko na mancyan jinyo am abo o ikadwa na no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Am da kapeykawaw jinyo no tao a komaro do manoyong a nanao ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1239007,"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. ",Am tana yamen a tana nimapo do teyngato a tinsi na ni Ama ta do to am no si macitarek a kano ninanao namen jinyo no kakwa o inanao da jinyo am manoyong akman sira ori a peydednan no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239008,"As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.",Nipanci namen rana jinyo no kakwa pa am yako ipanci pa jinyo am no myan so meylimwang nya jinyo so macitarek a nanao a kaji na meyyangayan a kano nimamizing nyo na no kakwa am manoyong o kapeydedna na jira no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to.
1239009,"For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. ","Manngwa, ko kakzeben o kazwazway da jyaken no tao a kapanci ko no akman sang? Jyabo kakman na sang a. O ko ikakza am azwain na yaken ni Ama ta do to. Manngwa, ko ikakza o kazwazway da jyaken no tao? No ikakza ko o tao a omazway jyaken am beken a lamlamsoy na yaken ni Kizisto."
1239010,"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. ","Manga kakteh, to ko na macitangayan jinyo am o ko ipeylimwang jinyo a Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am beken a nimyapo do tao. "
1239011,"For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.",Yabo yasa ka tao a ko nipacyamizngan a ko nipacinanawan so Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Ta si Yeso Kizisto o mina to manci rana nya jyaken. 
1239012,"For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: ",Nyo katenngan o iwawalam ko no kapacibedbed ko pa do anodan namen a tao do Yotay. Ta tey makdeng ko a mapakakasi so amraralay ni Yeso Kizisto a tao. Naknakmen ko o kawakwak ko sira. 
1239013,"and profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. ","Makdekdeng ko pa kano kapalangayan ko a tao do Yotay a mahap so iwawalam namen do anodan namen a tao do Yotay. Tana nanao da no ineynapo namen no kakwa am akman sang, ta tey makdeng ko a mangozay jya."
1239014,"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, ","No kaji ko pa nimatazakan a tao am nipamnekan na rana yaken a mahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to, do karilaw na nyaken. "
1239015,"to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: ",Nipacita na jyaken o Anak na. Am ori o nipakateneng ko do Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Kizisto a ipeylimwang do beken a tao do Yotay. So ikabo no tao a nipacyamizngan ko. 
1239016,"neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. ",Yako ji nimangay do Yelosaleng a macyamizing do nimanmanma pa ka nyaken a amlivolivon no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a tao. Ta nimangay ko do Alapo a kapeysinaoli ko na mangay do Tamaseke. 
1239017,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. ",Ikatlo na kawan am mangay ko ji Pite do Yelosaleng a macivahay jya so makalima so icyarwa (15) so araraw. 
1239018,"But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. ",So ji ko nimakacitai so karwan da nipamnekan na ni Yeso Kizisto a amlivolivon no ciriciring na. O wari na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta a meyngaran so Yake o nimacita ko. So ji ko nimakacitai so karwan da a nipamnekan na ni Yeso Kizisto a amlivolivon no ciriciring na.
1239019,"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. ",Yabo o yamalas do teygami ko ya a ciring ko. Pacyanoyngan na yaken ni Ama ta do to.
1239020,Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; ,Meyratateng am mangay ko na do Sidiya kado Cidicya. 
1239021,and was unknown by face unto the churches of Jud&#230; a which were in Christ: ,No kano nang am ji da pa nimacita yaken no sinjya do Yotay. 
1239022,"but they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. ",Kapakamizing da jyaken a yameylimwang rana no ciriciring na ni Kizisto a nimacioya jya no kakwa pa. 
1239023,And they glorified God in me.,"Am ori o yada rana sarayan ya ni Ama ta do to, do yako kapamlis rana a meylimwang no ciriciring na ni Yeso Kizisto."
1239024,"Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. ",Ikapat na so icyarwa (14) no awawan am macihza ko ji Parnapo a mangay do Yelosaleng a kapehza ko si Tito. 
1239025,"And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. ",O yangay ko do Yelosaleng am onotan ko o ciring na ni Ama ta do to a manci nya do panipanirsirngen no kyokay so mina vazay ko no kapeylimwang ko no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to do beken a tao do Yotay. Ta ji ko mamyapyan o kapanci da no vazay ko ji Ama ta do to no kakwa a kasicyakwaya abo so peypeypangayan. 
1239026,"But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: ","Ikongo do nisaray da o vazay ko no kanang, am ori o ji da nimgacigaci ji Tito amyongkad do kataotao na a mahap so iwawalam ni Moyse. Ta si Tito rana am beken a tao do Yotay, ta tao do Sila. "
1239027,"and that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: ","Am yamyan so tatasa ka tao a yanimacizavoz a yamapatpeh so kataotao da. Sira ori am kakzeben da si Tito a amyongkad do kataotao na. Am sira rana am beken a kayyai da, ta ileylamdamen da yamen a yamraralay ni Yeso Kizisto a tao. Ta manngo paro sira. Ala ahapen da o iwawalam ni Moyse. "
1239028,"to whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. ",Am ji namen mamyapyan o kablis na no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a nipeylimwang namen jinyo. Am ori o ji namen nimapaoyoi jira.
1239029,"But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: ","Am sira rana panipanirsirngen am ji ko ngezsangan o keynakem da, kato da katawwan. Ta si Ama ta do to rana am ji na nita o akman sang. O ko pancyan no nang am abo nikarahet da do ipangnanao ko. "
1239030,"but contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; ",To da rana tenngi o kanitomovoy na jyaken ni Ama ta do to a yamangay a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na do beken a tao do Yotay. Akman sang si Pite a nitovoy na ni Ama ta do to do tao do Yotay a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na. 
1239031,"(for he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) ","Ta si Ama ta do to o yaniomoyat jyaken a mangay do beken a tao do Yotay, akman si Pite a nitovoy na ni Ama ta do to a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na do tao do Yotay. "
1239032,"and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. ",Am katenngan da no panipanirsirngen do kyokay a si Yake a kani Pite a kani Yowani o ka yaken na no nipanta na ni Ama ta do to so oyowyat a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na do beken a tao do Yotay am isaray da yaken a kani Parnapo. Am ori o mina to da macipanadngi jyamen a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to do beken a tao do Yotay. Am sira am to sira tarek a mapamizing so tao do Yotay. 
1239033,Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do. ,Da kakzeben yamen a makanakem so makcin a tao do Yelosaleng. O akman rana sang am yamangday ori a yako naknakmen a vazay.
1239034,"But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. ","Mownay am mangay si Pite do Antia. Am ikongo do amyan so kalasan na, am ori o ninanawan ko sya. "
1239035,"For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. ",Ta no keyyan na rana ni Pite do Antia am nimacyakan do beken a tao do Yotay a sinjya. Am makaranes rana sira o nitovoy ni Yake a tao do Yotay am ji na ranadkeci ni Pite o kapacyakan na do beken a tao do Yotay. Ta ihawa na sira o tao do Yotay a mazyak nya. Ta sira rana am pangozayan da pa o iwawalam ni Moyse a amyongkad do kataotao da. 
1239036,And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. ,Macita da no karwan da no tao do Yotay si Pite a akmey jya nikoman am to da nginara si Pite. So nikakman na sang ni Parnapo. 
1239037,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?","Macita ko o iwawalam da a macisala do Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am maniring ko ji Pite do tangain da no aro a tao am, ""Imo am tao do Yotay ka. Am iwawalam mo am beken a tao do Yotay a yaji mangozay do adan a iwawalam ta a tao do Yotay. Ikeykongo ka yamgacigat do beken a tao do Yotay a mangozay do iwawalam da no tao do Yotay."
1239038,"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, ","""Yajyalas. Ta imo a ka nyaken am ta manoyong a yamacitetngehan do tao do Yotay. So ji ta nginarai so beken a tao do Yotay a ji ngahap so iwawalam ni Moyse. "
1239039,"knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. ","Am ta katenngan an, o ipacikaop no tao ji Ama ta do to am anoyngan si Yeso Kizisto. Beken a omagaz do kahap so iwawalam ni Moyse. Yaten rana am yata anoyngan si Yeso Kizisto. Am ori o ta ipacikaop ji Ama ta do to. So na ji monganai do ta kapangozay do iwawalam na ni Moyse. Ta abo o asa ka tao a meypapya no iwawalam na ni Moyse do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. "
1239040,"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. ","Yaten rana a yaomanoyong ji Kizisto a nibnek na ni Ama ta do to a abo rana so raraten do tangain na am no si meyyangay ta kano beken a tao do Yotay a meyraraten am manngwa, apyahen na ni Kizisto o kapeyraraten ta saon? Jyabo kapya na sya a. "
1239041,"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. ",Am no si olin ko pa hapen o iwawalam ni Moyse am raraten ko ori. 
1239042,"For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. ",Yaken rana am ko katenngan o kaji makahapan so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ko no si pangozayan ko o iwawalam ni Moyse. Am ori o ko na ji ngapi so iwawalam ni Moyse. Ta ko na hapen o vazay na ni Ama ta do to. Ko akmey to macizasing so kataotao ji Kizisto a nimawakwak do jyojika. 
1239043,"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. ","Am ori an, ikabeken a yaken rana no yamavyay sicyaikwaya. Ta si Kizisto rana o yamavyay do onowned ko. O yako ikavyay sicyaikwaya am yako ipeyhanhan o Anak na ni Ama ta do to. Na nikarilaw yaken a na nyangay no inawan. "
1239044,"I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.","Ko ji zazaci o pangangasyan na ni Ama ta do to. No si iwawalam na ni Moyse o abnekan na jyaken ni Ama ta do to a abo rana so raraten do tangain na am manngwa, abo saon o peypeypangayan no na kanimawakwak ni Kizisto am."""
1239045,"O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? ","Inyo rana abwata so kapsepsekan a tao do Cyalatay am yamanoyong na kanidomket ni Yeso Kizisto do jyojika. Am sinosino yamapeykawaw jinyo. Manngwa, kamo mavota saon? "
1239046,"This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? ",Pancyan kamo pala jyaken. Iwawalam na ni Moyse o yanyo ipakahap so Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to? No yapo do yanyo nimamizing a Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239047,"Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? ",Yakamo meypanngonngo a yakmey abo so nakem. No kakwa am nipeyhanhan nyo o Seyzi a tomalamozong ninyo. Am ikongo kamo a to mangozangozay do nyo ahapan sya a mapasaray si Ama ta do to sicyaikwaya. 
1239048,Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. ,"Manngwa, abo peypeypangayan na no kato nyo meyrektan do mina alalaw nyo no kakwa? Jyabo kakman na sang a. "
1239049,"He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? ","Na nitoro ni Ama ta do to o Seyzi jinyo a yamapeyvazay so mapeyzokab a vazay. Am manngwa, yamonganay ori do yanyo kahap so iwawalam na ni Moyse? No yamonganay do yanyo kanimakamizing so Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to."
1239050,"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.","Akman si Apolahan a nimalavat da do Seysyo. Maniring am, ""Iya rana am nyanoyngan na si Ama ta do to. Am ori o nibnekan na sya a abo so raraten do tangain na."""
1239051,"Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. ","Am ori an, no si myan so tao a meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to am manoyong ori a macikownongan ji Apolahan. "
1239052,"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. ","Nipaziman na rana ni Ama ta do to do Seysyo o kabnek na so beken a tao do Yotay a abo so raraten do tangain na, do kapeyhanhan da ni Ama ta do to. So nipazimanan na rana sya ji Apolahan so akman sang a Mapasaray a Ciriciring no kakwa pa. Maniring am, ""Mamimin o tao do karawan a ipanta ko so aryarilaw ko, do mo kapeyhanhan nyaken."""
1239053,So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.,Nyanoyngan na ni Apolahan. Ori o nikarilawan na nya ni Ama ta do to. So ikamimin no omanoyong jya tao a ikarilaw na ni Ama ta do to.
1239054,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. ","O tao a meyhanhan no iwawalam na ni Moyse am meydedna jira o peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to, do kaji da makataptapan sya a peyvazain. Ta o ciring do Seysyo am, ""O tao a ji makataptap sya peyvazain so yadomket a iwawalam ni Moyse am mangay jira o peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to."""
1239055,"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. ","Ori o ikanoyong no kabo no asa ka tao a abneken na ni Ama ta do to a abo so raraten do tangain na a mangozay do iwawalam ni Moyse. Ta o ciring do Seysyo am, ""O meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to a tao o abneken na abo so raraten do tangain na. So ikanoyong na rana makahap so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad na."""
1239056,"And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. ","Am o iwawalam na ni Moyse am abo kasngesngenan na do kapeyhanhan ni Ama ta do to. Ta o ciring do Seysyo am, ""O mangozay do iwawalam na ni Moyse am abo dang o likliken a ciring."""
1239057,"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: ","Am si Kizisto o nimalit jyaten do oyaoyyan na nyaten ni Ama ta do to a ji makataptap so iwawalam na ni Moyse. Ta o ciring pa do Seysyo am, ""O nipadket da do jyojika am iya o nyangayan no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to."""
1239058,that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.,"O nikakman na sang ni Yeso Kizisto am ikakza na o aryarilaw na ni Ama ta do to si Apolahan a mangay na itoro do beken a tao do Yotay. So ta rana ikamimin a makahap so Seyzi a nipanci na itoro na jyaten ni Ama ta do to, do kapeyhanhan ta nya."
1239059,"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. ","Manga kakteh, o ahahapan sya no tao am no meysirisiring o rarwa ka tao do vazay da am to da na mamneki o apyahen da. So ikabo rana no mapasobna do nipamnekan da vazay, do kabo rana no nipeyras da vazay. "
1239060,"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. ","Akman sang an, o nipanci ni Ama ta do to a nakem na a itoro na ji Apolahan a kano asa ka tao do sivosivovoong na. So ji na nimapakaciringi sya do aro a tao, ta asa ka tao. Iya rana am si Kizisto. "
1239061,"And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. ",O peypeypangayan no ciring ko am ji meyyopowpas o nimanmanma a nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a ciring na. Tana nimanownowji o iwawalam ni Moyse so atlo a poo so ikasikalima ranaw (430) so awawan am jyablis o mina ciring na ni Ama ta do to ji Apolahan. 
1239062,"For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.",Ta no si pangozayan ta o iwawalam na ni Moyse o torwan na jyaten so aryarilaw na ni Ama ta do to am beken a monganay ori do mina ciring na ni Ama ta do to. Ta o nitoro na aryarilaw na ji Apolahan am pangononongan na ni Ama ta do to o mina ciring na jya.
1239063,"Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. ",Am ikongo peypeypangayan na no iwawalam ni Ama ta do to a nitaid na ji Moyse. O iwawalam rana ori am ipakateneng no tao do raraten da mangay do yai no sivovoong ni Apolahan a si Kizisto. Am no kano nang am tinsi o nitomoro nya ji Moyse so iwawalam ang a katoro na rana nya do tao. 
1239064,"Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. ",Am si Ama ta do to o nimacisirsiring ji Apolahan.
1239065,"Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. ","No akman sang am manngwa, masipalpalpid o iwawalam ni Moyse a kano pangozayan na a ciring a nitoro na ni Ama ta do to? Jyabo kakman na sang a. No si manoyong o kapakahap ta no iwawalam ni Moyse so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta am makanet rana ori a ipacikaop ta ji Ama ta do to. "
1239066,"But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.","Am o ciring do Seysyo am yatodamimin o tao do karawan a yamabedbed no raraten. Am ori an, no kakzeben ta o kapakahap ta so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta am kapeyhanhan ta ni Yeso Kizisto. Ta ori rana am mina ciring na ori ni Ama ta do to do amraralay nya tao."
1239067,"But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. ","Am no kabo pa ni Yeso a ipeyhanhan ta am apya, ta amyan so iwawalam ni Moyse a omzat do onowned ta. "
1239068,"Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. ","Am ori o icyakma ney inyapwan ta no iwawalam ni Moyse amzat do onowned ta mangay do yai na rana ni Kizisto a kabnek na rana jyaten ni Ama ta do to a abo rana so raraten do tangain na, do kapeyhanhan ta nya. "
1239069,"But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.",Sicyaikwa rana ya am yarana amyan si Kizisto. Am ori o na rana ji amzaci do onowned ta no iwawalam ni Moyse.
1239070,For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. ,"Inyo rana am kamo rana mamimin a akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to, do yanyo rana kapeyhanhan ni Yeso Kizisto. "
1239071,For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. ,Inyo rana am kamo rana a nimamlis so onowned a nitaktakan rana a yarana macikaop ji Kizisto a ominara so icicirawat na. 
1239072,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. ","Am ori o ikabo rana no matarek do amraralay ni Yeso Kizisto a tao. Ta meyyangangay sira do tangain na. Tana tao do Yotay a tana beken a tao do Yotay, tana lamlamsoy a kano beken a lamlamsoy, tana mahakay a tana mavakes am kamo mamimin a akmey asa rana a yamacikaop ji Yeso Kizisto. "
1239073,"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.",No kamo macilovot ji Kizisto am manoyong kamo na a macikownongan ji Apolahan a omamoon so aryarilaw na ni Ama ta do to si Apolahan.
1239074,"Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. ","Am tana kanakan o omamoon so kangangay na ni ama na am abo peytarkan na kano lamlamsoy, ta ji pa teneng o kanakan a meymatmatngeh no kangangay na. Am ori o iyan no makaveyvow a tao a somidong sya a meymatmatngeh no kangangay na, mangay do ipakaveyvow na rana. Am tana kanakan o omamoon so kangangay na ni ama na am abo peytarkan na kano lamlamsoy, ta ji pa teneng o kanakan a meymatmatngeh no kangangay na. Am ori o iyan no makaveyvow a tao a somidong sya a meymatmatngeh no kangangay na, mangay do ipakaveyvow na rana. "
1239075,"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: ","Akman sang an, ta no kaji ta pa meypahagnatan so nakenakem ji Kizisto no kakwa am akma tey lamlamsoy a italamozong no jyapsepsek a iwawalam no tao do karawan. "
1239076,"but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, ",Am marateng rana o araraw a nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to am tovoin na rana o Anak na alavaten no asa ka mavakes a italamozong no iwawalam ni Moyse. 
1239077,"to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.",O ikakman na sang am ovayan na sira o mavaod no iwawalam na ni Moyse a tao. So ikanoyong ta rana meyngongyod a akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to.
1239078,"And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. ",O nitovoyan na sya jinyo ni Ama ta do to so Seyzi ni Kizisto am kamo meyngongyod rana akma ney anak. Am ori o nyo jyanigi a yatomawag ji Ama ta do to a Ama nyo. 
1239079,"Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.","Inyo rana sicyaikwaya am beken a lamlamsoy kamo rana a na italamozong no iwawalam ni Moyse, ta akma ney anak rana inyo ni Ama ta do to. O akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to am ori o makahap so aryarilaw na."
1239080,"Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. ",No kakwa pa am ji nyo a tenngi si Ama ta do to. Am ori o ikanoyong nyo a lamlamsoy no makakaday a malas a iraralay nyo. 
1239081,"But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? ","Am nyo katenngan si Ama ta do to sicyaikwaya. So na ipakateneng jinyo ni Ama ta do to a akma ney anak. Am ikongo kamo a yapa mangay amwoli so makanyaw a iwawalam nyo a abo so peypeypangayan. Manngwa, nyo apyapyahen pa o kakma nyoy lamlamsoy no makanyaw? "
1239082,"Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. ",Nyo pahamahamahen pa o pamarmarngan nyo so kanen do araraw a kado vehavehan a kado awawan. 
1239083,"I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.","So ko kalawan ninyo an, do na kakmey meyyopowpas a cinalab no ninanao ko jinyo no kakwa."
1239084,"Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all. ","Manga kakteh, inaoy si inarahen nyo yaken a ji rana mangozay do iwawalam ni Moyse. Ta beken a iwawalam nyo o kapangozay nyo do iwawalam ni Moyse a beken a tao do Yotay. Am ori o ko sarayan ninyo."
1239085,Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. ,Ta no keyngen ko am nipeyveyveken nyo yaken no ka ori pa so kapeylimwang ko no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to jinyo. 
1239086,"And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. ","Tana nyo ikarahet no kangangay o ingingnen ko am nyo jya nikahayo yaken. Ta nyo nipehngay yaken do tinsi na ni Ama ta do to a taotawwen. So icyakma koy Yeso Kizisto a nitaotao nyo, "
1239087,"Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. ","kasasaray nyo no kano nang, kaji nyo ngosowan so mata nyo a itoro jyaken, do nyo karilawan nyaken. Am kamo makongokongo sicyaikwaya. "
1239088,"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? ",Ala ori nyo oyyan yaken am ko na ji nayotaywa o ciring ko a ko ivavaga jinyo.
1239089,"They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them. ",Sira rana yamnanao jinyo no malas am da kakzeben o kapacioya nyo jyaken a kaglaw nyo nira. 
1239090,"But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. ",Apya o karilaw da ninyo. Am ney yapya na am tana myan ko dang a tana abo ko dang am to meyyonong o karilawan da ninyo. 
1239091,"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, ","Kamo akmey anak ko na. Ta yatey rako o aryarilaw ko jinyo. So yako icyakmey mavakes a toda jyapaw so totowang so alalaw a omnanao jinyo, mangay no si meynara nyo na si Yeso Kizisto so icicirawat. "
1239092,"I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.","Ko toda ji nalap a macikaop jinyo a kaji ko na ratan ninyo so kangangay, do kahawa ninyo a da pamizngen no malas a ciring."
1239093,"Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? ","Inyo rana yamangozay do iwawalam ni Moyse sicyaikwaya am manngwa, nyo katenngan o ciriciring a yadomket do iwawalam na ni Moyse an? "
1239094,"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. ",O nivatvatkan do Seysyo am rarwa o anak ni Apolahan. Asa am anak no lamlamsoy na. Asa am anak no meyngongyod a mavakes na. 
1239095,But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise. ,O anak no lamlamsoy na am omaing do pamnemnekan na. Am o anak no meyngongyod a mavakes na am omaing do mina ciring na jya ni Ama ta do to. 
1239096,"Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. ",Sira rana ya rarwa ka mavakes am kehngehngay no adan a kano vayo a pangozayan a ciring ni Ama ta do to. O meyngaran so Hacya a lamlamsoy am omagaz do iwawalam na ni Moyse do Sinay a tokon. O ipanci da ananak ni Hacya tao am pangozayan da o iwawalam na ni Moyse. So icyakma dey lamlamsoy no iwawalam na ni Moyse. 
1239097,"For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. ",O Sinay a tokon am amyan do Alapo. Akma ney kehngehngay no tao do Yelosaleng a mangozay do iwawalam ni Moyse. 
1239098,"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. ","Am o mavakes a meyngaran si Salay am akma tey ina, do kakma ney mapehngehngay sya do Yelosaleng do teyngato a ji rana nalamozongan no iwawalam na ni Moyse. "
1239099,"For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.","Ta o ciring do Seysyo a omaing ji Salay am, ""Imo rana ji meytaodtod a ji pa nimangalavat a mavakes am somaray ka an. Imo rana ji pa nimacizaza mavakes am arakorako pa o sarasaray mo, ta pasaoden ko jimo o ananak mo. So ikanoyong mo a arwaro pa so anak a kano lamlamsoy da mavakes."""
1239100,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. ","Manga kakteh, kamo na meyvaliw a akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to. Ta yarana nimangononong jinyo o ciring na ni Ama ta do to, akman si Isa a anak ni Salay. Ta iya rana am nimangononong o ciring na ni Ama ta do to ji Apolahan. "
1239101,"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now. ",No kano nang am o anak na ni Hacya am nipeyrarahet na o kakteh na si Isa a nimalikey apo do Seyzi. Yakman so tao do Yotay sicyaikwaya a yamangozay do iwawalam na ni Moyse a yamapakakasi jyaten. 
1239102,Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. ,"Am o ciring do Seysyo am, ""Pagcinen mo o lamlamsoy mo a mavakes a kano anak na. Ta o anak no lamlamsoy mo am ji macivonong do kangangay mo. Ta o kangangay mo am amoonen no meyngongyod a anak no mavakes mo."""
1239103,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.","Ori an, manga kakteh an, ta ji macikownongi do anak no lamlamsoy a mavakes. Ta yaten rana am akma ney anak yaten ni Ama ta do to, do yata kaji mangozayan rana do adan a pangozayan a ciring."
1239104,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.",Na rana niovayan yaten ni Kizisto do yamvaod jyaten a iwawalam ni Moyse. Ori o ji nyo rana meyhanhani no adan a iwawalam ni Moyse.
1239105,"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. ",To ko na macitangayan jinyo am no si ipeyhanhan nyo o kayongkad do kataotao nyo a ipasaray nyo si Ama ta do to am abo peypeypangayan ni Kizisto jinyo. 
1239106,"For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. ",Ko pazimanen pa jinyo so ipisa. No si yongkadan nyo o kataotao nyo am pangononongan nyo saon o aro a iwawalam ni Moyse am. 
1239107,"Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. ","Inyo rana yamnakenakem so kabnek na jinyo a abo so raraten ni Ama ta do to a yamangozay do iwawalam na ni Moyse am kanyo manoyong a yameyparai ji Kizisto, do nyo kataosya so oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to a yasomidong jinyo. "
1239108,For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. ,Am yaten rana am na oyatan yaten no Seyzi a meyhanhan ni Yeso Kizisto. Am ori o na abnekan rana jyaten ni Ama ta do to a abo rana so raraten do tangain na. 
1239109,"For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.",Ta o tao a macikaop rana ji Yeso Kizisto am ji na rana ngezsangan o kaji na yongkadan do kataotao na. Ta o ney makdeng na ji Ama ta do to am ipeyhanhan ta si Kizisto a kapangarilaw ta so icyatatao ta.
1239110,Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? ,Kanyo tey yapya so ahahapan sya a yamnakenakem si Kizisto. Sino a yamazazat jinyo a yanyo kaji ngonotan do manoyong a nanao. 
1239111,This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. ,Jyabo ka si Ama ta do to no amzazat jinyo a. Ta iya o nimamnek jinyo a omanoyong ji Yeso. 
1239112,A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. ,Ta naknakmen nyo pala o kosozi no odong. Tana alikey pazavozen am mapeymway na o nipeysolisoliket a odong. Akman sang o malas a nanao a makeykai a meylimwang a ikarahet no tao. 
1239113,"I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. ","Am ko ipeyhanhan inyo, do ta kapeyyangangay a macikaop ji Kizisto. Yabo kapacitarek no nakenakem nyo jyaken a. O tao rana mapeyzavozavoz jinyo am mangay a meydedna jya o peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to."
1239114,"And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. ",No si ipeylimwang ko o kayongkad do kataotao am ikongo da rehrehtan jyaken. O da rehrehtan jyaken am ko ipeylimwang o jyojika ni Kizisto. Am ori o da oyyan nyaken no ji raralay ni Yeso. 
1239115,I would they were even cut off which trouble you.,Ko apyapyahen pa o kato da na ngarwan jinyo no yamapeyzavozavoz jinyo a tao.
1239116,"For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. ","Manga kakteh, o na nipamnekan jinyo ni Ama ta do to am na ovayan inyo a yamvaod no iwawalam ni Moyse. Am ori o ji nyo to mamyapyai no kataotao nyo a italamozong no marahet a nakenakem nyo. Apyapya pa o pangarilawan a isidong nyo so kadwan jinyo. "
1239117,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. ","Ta yana to zagoma no pangangarilawan o iwawalam na ni Moyse. Ta si ahapen ta o ciring do Seysyo a manci no, ""O aryarilaw mo so kataotao mo am akman sang o karilawan mo no icyatatao mo,"" am nimahap ta rana o iwawalam ni Moyse. "
1239118,"But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.",Am no si akman kamo so omalalam a somongisongit so kadwan jinyo am jyabo kapya nyo a.
1239119,"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. ",O yako ipanci am onotan nyo o peypalanginan na ninyo no Seyzi an. Ta ori o ipakazazat nyo do onowned nyo a to mangozangozay do apyahen nyo no nakem. 
1239120,"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. ","Ta o marahet a ikeykakza no kataotao ta am macitarek a kano ikakza na jyaten no Seyzi. So icyakma dey meykavosoyan, do kazazat na jyaten no Seyzi a mangozay do marahet a ikeykakza no kataotao ta. "
1239121,"But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. ",No si peypalanginan na inyo no Seyzi am ji na rana vaoda inyo no iwawalam na ni Moyse.
1239122,"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, ","Mapengkad o marahet a vazay no tao. Ta to rana tenngi do icicirawat da, akman so macimasesnek a vazay, "
1239123,"idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, ","manaralay so malas a iraralay a kano mamnek a kano meyliliman a kano maoyaoyahen a kano mararaten a kano mapeysyasyay so nakem no tao, "
1239124,"envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. ",manginanahet a kano mayoyopen so saki a kano makakaday pa a ikarahet no tao a vazay. Oya rana am nipaziman ko na jinyo no kakwa. Am yako olin pa ipanci jinyo.

1239125,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, ","O italamozong no Seyzi a tao am mangarilaw, masaray, apiya o nakenakem na, jyaharag no alalaw, mazonos, manidong so tao, ji mangalalas, "
1239126,"meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. ","ji mapahama so nakem, ji to mangozangozay do nakem. So ikabo no pasobnan na a ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to no akman sang a tao. "
1239127,And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.,"O yaomanod ji Yeso Kizisto a tao am akma dey nipazanod o marahet a nakenakem da do jyojika ni Yeso Kizisto, do kanimawakwak na no raraten ta."
1239128,"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. ",Manoyong o kanimanta na rana nyaten no Seyzi so vayo a onowned ta. Am ori o na ikanoyong a yatomalamozong nyaten. 
1239129,"Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.",Ji ta mapahama so nakem. Ji ta pasozisozya o kadwan jyaten. Ji ta manginanahet.
1239130,"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. ","Manga kakteh, inyo rana yamakdeng so nakem ji Ama ta do to am no myan so tao a to meyraraten am ji nyo anigan a pamizngen. Am taosya o kapahama nyo so onowned nyo a mapamizing sya.

1239131,"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. ",No myan so alalaw nyo am macisidosidong kamo. Ta ori rana am nanao na jyaten ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1239132,"For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. ",O mapakateneteneng a tao am akma ney littan o kataotao na. 
1239133,"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. ","So ikamimin no tao a manakenakem a manci no, ""Manngwa, yapya no yamarahet o iwawalam ko."" No si apya am manoyong o kasaray na. So ji mapadmai so kataotao do icyatatao. "
1239134,For every man shall bear his own burden.,So ikamimin no tao a macipanoyonoyong a ji makanet so nakenakem do tangain na ni Ama ta do to.
1239135,Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. ,Inyo rana da pamizngen no nanao ni Ama ta do to am sidongen nyo o yamapamizing jinyo no nanao na ni Ama ta do to a tao. Ipanta nyo sira so makakaday a apyahen da no nakem.
1239136,"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. ",Ji kamo manayotayo do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. Ta abo matayo ta do tangain na. So ikanoyong no kapacilocilolo no mahap no tao do makakaday a mina vazay na. 
1239137,For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. ,Ta no myan so tao a to mangozangozay do nakenakem na am mangay o kapakahap na so to meyyonong a alalaw do makotokotod a lila no apoy.

1239140,Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. ,"Citahen nyo an, o yararako a vatvatek. Ta ori rana am yako nivatvatkan ori."
1239141,"As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. ",Sira rana mapazway so kataotao da a yamanci ninyo a amyongkad do kataotao nyo am o da ikakman sang am ikanyahey da sira o mapakakasi sira no mangnanao sira no jyojika na ni Kizisto.

1239142,"For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. ",Am sira rana a nimyongkad do kataotao da am da jyamimin o iwawalam na ni Moyse a yamahap. O da pancyan ninyo a amyongkad do kataotao nyo am da pazwain o kaniomamizing nyo sira. 
1239143,"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. ","Am yaken rana am yabo ikadwa na no yako pazwain, ta si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta o yako pazwain a yanimawakwak nyaten do jyojika.

1239144,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. ",So ji na ranakdengi no kayongkad do kataotao. Ta makdekdeng o vazay no Seyzi a omyavayo so onowned ta. 
1239145,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.","Inaoy no si ikarilaw na sira ni Ama ta do to o yamangozay do ciriciring ko, pacyangayan da no tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay, kapanta na nira so ikapiya no onowned da."

Ori o na nitorwan rana no Seyzi jinyo ni Ama ta do to akma ney yongkad no kapacikownongan nyo rana jya. "
1239161,"which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.",O Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to am ori o akma tey yongkad a somidong jyaten a omamoon so nipanci na itoro ni Ama ta do to do monganay jya tao. So ikanoyong na ni Ama ta do to a mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato a yaomanoyong jya tao. So sarayan ta ni Ama ta do to a tey mazway a Tao do to!
1239162,"Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, ","Am ori an, mamizing ko na inyo a meyhanhan rana ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta a marilaw no akma nyoy kakteh do cinai am, "
1239163,"cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; ",ji ko ranamtad a somaray ninyo ji Ama ta do to. So ikasangib ko a makalavat jinyo do inozi ko. 
1239164,"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: ",Ko mapasyasi ji Ama ta do to a tey mazway a Tao do to a Ama na ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta a manta ninyo so teneng a kapakateneng nyo rana ji Ama ta do to. 
1239165,"the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, ",Ko mapasyasi ji Ama ta do to a omiwang do onowned nyo a kapakateneng nyo na do peypeypangayan no na panopan jinyo a kapanta na ninyo so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad nyo do teyngato. So ikatey rako na no aryarilaw na so omanoyong jya tao. 
1239166,"and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, ",Yamapeyzokab o na vazay no oyowyat na do yaomanoyong jya tao. Oyowyat rana ori am 
1239167,"which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, ","nimapeyvangon si Yeso apo do heseb na. So na rana iyan do teyngato a yaomlisna do wanan na ni Ama ta do to, "
1239168,"far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: ",a kabtekan rana a Panirsirngen do sinokob no hanit. So ikabo rana no makahad so oyowyat na kano azwazway na do karawan a kado teyngato mangay do kaidan no karawan. 
1239169,"and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, ",Abo ji na nalamozongan ni Kizisto do karawan. Ta iya o yameymatmatngeh nyaten a omanoyong jya tao. 
1239170,"which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.","Yaten rana yamraralay ni Kizisto am akma ney kataotao yaten, do ta kararalay nya, do na kanimapeypapya so makakaday."
1239171,"And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; ",No kaji nyo pa manaralayan am pasobnan nyo pa o ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a meyraraten. 
1239172,"wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: ",No kano nang am onotan nyo pa o malas a vazay da no ji manganoyong a tao a kano ciring ni Satan a yatomalamozong no meyraraten a tao. 
1239173,"among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. ",No kakwa am akman tamo sira a to mangozangozay do nakenakem da. Am ori o ikanoyong ta meyraraten a tao a pasingsingtan na ni Ama ta do to no makwa.
1239174,"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) ","Am tana akman ta sang a meyraraten a tao no kakwa am yatey rako o na karilawan nyaten ni Ama ta do to, do kanimanta na nyaten so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta a macikaop rana ji Kizisto.

Am tana akman ta sang a meyraraten a tao no kakwa am yatey rako o na karilawan nyaten ni Ama ta do to, do kanimanta na nyaten so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta a macikaop rana ji Kizisto. So ta ikanoyong a yana nipatazadang no pangangarilawan na. "
1239175,"and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: ",Na rana nipazasing yaten so inawan ji Yeso Kizisto a nimirwa a mavyay. So icyakma tey macikaop jya amyan do teyngato. 
1239176,that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. ,O ikakman na sang ni Ama ta do to am ipacita na do kaidan no karawan o mapeyzokab a pangangarilawan na kano pangangasyan na jyaten a yamacikaop ji Yeso Kizisto. 
1239177,For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: ,"Na nyahap inyo do peyraratenan nyo, ta nyo rana ipeyhanhan si Kizisto. O nyo ipakahap so sang am beken a oyowyat nyo, ta omagaz do pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a na yazaw jinyo. "
1239178,"not of works, lest any man should boast. ",Am ori o ji nyo pahamai so nakem nyo. Ta beken a omaing do kapya no icicirawat nyo o na nyahapan jinyo ni Ama ta do to. 
1239179,"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.",Si Ama ta do to o yata nikablis no onowned a yarana macikaop ji Yeso Kizisto. So na ikapya rana no vazay ta a mangonong do na peypalanginan nyaten ni Ama ta do to.
1239180,"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; ","Am ori an, pakanakman nyo so kataotao nyo a ji da nipazasing no tao do Yotay a omraralay ni Ama ta do to no kakwa, do kaji nyo nginaran sira amyongkad do kataotao nyo. "
1239181,"that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: ","No kano nang am abo o kasngesngenan nyo ji Kizisto, ta akma kamoy kadwan a ji da patwatopa do tangain ni Ama ta do to, do kaji nyo macitetngehan do tao do Yotay. Ta sira am nipanta na sira ni Ama ta do to so pangozayan na ciring. So ikanoyong nyo a to rana hayo so onowned, do kaji nyo makatenngan ji Ama ta do to. "
1239182,but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. ,Am inyo rana a ji ngasngen ji Ama ta do to a tao am na rana nipanop inyo ji Yeso Kizisto sicyaikwaya. So nyo ikanoyong rana yamacikaop ji Ama ta do to. Ta na nikawakwak rana inyo ni Kizisto. 
1239183,"For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; ",Iya o yamapeyyanowanop jyaten a tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay. Na nibalinas no kataotao na o yakmey atoy a yamapeysyay so tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay a da pacikaoyyan. 
1239184,"having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; ",O na nyangay so inawan ni Kizisto am na niblis o yada hanhan no tao do Yotay a iwawalam ni Moyse. So icyakma dey yasa rana no tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay do tangain ni Kizisto. No si manoyong kakma tey yasa rana am apya ta na so nakem do kadwan jyaten. 
1239185,"and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: ","O nikawakwak na ni Kizisto do jyojika am balinasen na o kakma tey meykavosoyan. O jyojika na ni Yeso Kizisto o mapeyyanowanop jyaten, akmey asa ka tao so onowned a meyyangangay rana amraralay ni Ama ta do to. "
1239186,"and came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. ","O na nyai ni Kizisto am na ipeylimwang do aro a tao o Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to, pacyangayan nyo a beken a tao do Yotay a ji makateneng ji Ama ta do to no kakwa ka nira tao do Yotay. "
1239187,For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. ,"Na peyyanowanopen yaten ni Kizisto a tao do Yotay a kano beken a tao do Yotay, akmey asa so onowned do tangain na ni Ama ta do to a yana sidongen no Seyzi."
1239188,"Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; ","Am ori an, ikabeken nyo rana kadwan a beken a tao do Yotay an. Ta tamo na mamimin a akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to a yakmey yasa ka vahay. "
1239189,"and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; ",Ta nyo nimahap rana o nanao da no nipamnekan ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na kano mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. So na ikamimin no nang a yapo ji Yeso Kizisto. 
1239190,in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: ,Iya o yatomalamozong nyaten a yamanta nyaten so ji meylimoteng a onowned ta. 
1239191,in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.,Am ori o nyo ipeyyangangay rana kano tao do Yotay a na rana yanan no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to.
1239192,"For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, ",O peypeypangayan no ko iyan do pamemtengan am ko ipeylimwang no ciriciring na ni Yeso Kizisto jinyo a beken a tao do Yotay. Tana akman ko sang am yako jimtadan a meynozi ninyo. 
1239193,if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: ,Nyo katenngan yaken a na nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to a yameylimwang nya jinyo so pangangarilawan na. 
1239194,"how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, ",Na nipananao jyaken ni Ama ta do to o vazay na a jyatenngi no kakwa. So yako rana ipakateneng jya. So nipakalavatan ko na sya jinyo. 
1239195,"whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) ",No si vilangan nyo o teygami ko eya am katenngan nyo rana ori a omaing ji Yeso Kizisto. 
1239196,"which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; ",No kakwa am abo pa tao a nimapatwaw so nanao eya a omaing ji Kizisto. Am sicyaikwaya am na rana patwawen no Seyzi do nipamnekan na ni Yeso a omlivolivon no ciriciring na tao a kado mangononong so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239197,"that the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: ","O ji da nipatwaw a nanao na am na rana pazanoden o beken a tao do Yotay do meyngongyod a tao do Yotay a makahap so aryarilaw na jyaten ni Ama ta do to, do kanimakamizing nyo rana so Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Kizisto. So nyo rana icyakmey yasa so nakem a kano tao do Yotay a meyhanhan ni Yeso Kizisto a makahap so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad nyo."
1239198,"whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. ",Na nitenngan yaken ni Ama ta do to a lamlamsoy na a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na. Am pangangarilawan ni Ama ta do to a kano oyowyat na o yasomidong jyaken a yamahap so vazay na. 
1239199,"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; ",Tana mina saod na so kabo no kapsepsekan ko am na manket yaken a pahanhanen a meylimwang nya jinyo a beken a tao do Yotay so aglaglaw na jyaten ni Kizisto. 
1239200,"and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: ",Na nipanta yaken so oyowyat ko a somidong so tao do karawan a makateneng do pamnemnekan na ni Ama ta do to a nimangamaog so karawan. Ta no kakwa pa am abo pa makateneng jya tao. 
1239201,"to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, ",Ta na kakzeben ni Ama ta do to o kapakacita da sya no tinsi jyaten a yamraralay nya tao so apiya vazay na kano teneteneng na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239202,according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: ,O na akmanan sang ni Ama ta do to am na pangozayan o to meyyonong a pamnemnekan na. Am na rana nipangononongan ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. 
1239203,in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. ,"Am ori o ji ta na nyahei a mangay do tangain na ni Ama ta do to, do kapeyhanhan ta ni Kizisto. "
1239204,"Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.",Am ori an o ko pakotokotan pa sya jinyo. Taosya o kahaha nyo so nakem do iyan no alalaw ko. Ta o akman sang am isaray nyo o mina kapeylimwang ko no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to jinyo.
1239205,"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, ","Am ori an, yako ipeylilitod a meynozi do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. "
1239206,"of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, ",Sira rana o yamyan do teyngato a kano yapa amyan do teyrahem am mamimin sira akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to. 
1239207,"that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; ",Ko ipeynozi ji Ama ta do to o kowyat na jinyo no Seyzi a meypakdeng so nakem ji Ama ta do to. Ta iya rana am yatey mowyat a yatey mazway a Tao do to. 
1239208,"that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, ",Ori o ipakateneng nyo ji Kizisto a manoyong rana a yamacikaop jinyo a yatomalamozong ninyo. Ko ipeynozi inyo a mapayamot so pangangarilawan na do onowned nyo. 
1239209,"may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; ",Ta ori o ipeyyangangay nyo a kano aro a akma nyoy kakteh do cinai a makateneng do mapeyzokab a pangangarilawan na ni Kizisto. 
1239210,"and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. ",Tana yajyatenngi no tao o na pamanmandan no mapeyzokab a pangangarilawan na ni Kizisto am inaoy si meypahagnat kamo so nakem a makateneng do pangangarilawan na. No si makman kamo sang am manoyong kamo na a yanan no aglaglaw na jinyo ni Ama ta do to.
1239211,"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, ",Oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to am ori o yameyvazay do onowned ta a omoyat jyaten a meyhanhan nya. Ori o yata ipakahap so yamapeyzokab a ji tangtoktwan a vazay. 
1239212,"unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.",Inaoy si pangozayan ta a yamraralay ni Yeso Kizisto a tao o kato ta meyyonongan a zomwazway si Ama ta do to sicyaikwaya mangay do kaidan no karawan. Amin.
1239213,"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, ",O yako iyan do pamemtengan sicyaikwaya am yako peyvazain o vazay na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. So yako pancyan ninyo a omzat do icicirawat nyo. So ikanoyong nyo a macipayok so icicirawat ji Kizisto. 
1239214,"with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; ",Taosya o kapahama nyo so nakem nyo. Apyapya pa kapiya no nakem nyo do icyatatao nyo. Ji kamo meyoyaoya. Ta karilaw nyo no kadwan jinyo. 
1239215,endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. ,Makowyowyat kamo pa mapeyyanowanop so kadwan jinyo. Ta ori o icyakma nyoy yasa so onowned a yanan no Seyzi. 
1239216,"There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; ",Ta yaten rana yamraralay ni Yeso am yata akmey yasa so kataotao. Yasa o Seyzi a yamyan jyaten a yasa so ipeynanakem a yameyhanhan ni Ama ta do to a yanimapanop jyaten. 
1239217,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism, ",Yasa o Panirsirngen ta. Yasa o ta ipeyhanhan. Yasa o ta pangozayan so ngaran a tomaktak jyaten. 
1239218,"one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. ","Yasa o Tao do to ta, akma tey Ama do karawan. Iya rana am yameymatmatngeh nyaten a yamraralay nya tao a yamacikaop jyaten a mapakavos so vazay na do karawan."
1239219,But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. ,Am yameykataretarek o na nitoro jyaten ni Yeso Kizisto a teneteneng ta. Am na to mangozai o nakem na a yatomoro nya jyaten. 
1239220,"Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men.","Akman so ciring do Seysyo. Ta maniring am, ""No kapeycyakavat na rana do teyngato am niharag na si Satan a kano kalamsoyan na a kapanta na no yaomanod jya tao so teneteneng a kano oyowyat da."""
1239221,"(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? ",O peypeypangayan no kanimeycyakavat na do teyngato am nimanmanma mai do karawan. 
1239222,"He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) ",O nimeygegcin do karawan am iya o nimeycyakavat do teyngato. O ikakman na sang am na itoro do tao do karawan o mapeyzokab a aryarilaw na. 
1239223,"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; ","Iya o nimanta no tao so teneteneng a kano oyowyat da. Nitenngan na o tatasa ka tao a amlivolivon no ciriciring na, kapamnek na do tatasa ka tao a mangononong so ciriciring na, kapamnek na do tatasa ka tao a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na. So iyan no tao a panirsirngen do kyokay amnanao so sinjya. "
1239224,"for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: ",O ikakman na sang am ipakasidong da so aro a omanod ji Ama ta do to a tao a meypahagnat so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to. Ta yaten rana am akma ney kataotao ni Kizisto. 
1239225,"till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: ","So ikamimin ta akmey yasa meyhanhan nya a makateneng ji Yeso a Anak na ni Ama ta do to a akmey makaveyvow a tao a makataptap rana so nanao ni Kizisto, "
1239226,"that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; ","a ji rana akman so kanakan, akmey azda a kano pagpag a jyatenngi so pamnemnekan a to ngonongonot so nakem do mangalalas so ciring a tao. "
1239227,"but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: ",Ji ta mangononong so malas. Ta pangozayan ta o pangangarilawan a macisirsiring do icyatatao ta. Ta ori o ipeypahagnat ta so onowned a ominara si Kizisto a yameymatmatngeh nyaten. 
1239228,"from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.","Yaten rana yamraralay nya tao am akma ney kataotao yaten. Iya am yatomalamozong nyaten. Ori ta icyakmey yasa so nakenakem yamarilaw no kadwan jyaten. Ta yaten rana akmey meyketeketeh do cinai am cinamaog no kataotao na. No si akma tey yasa mapanod so nakenakem ta ji Kizisto am tey rako o oyowyat ta, do kapeyyanowanop na jyaten no pangangarilawan na ni Kizisto."
1239229,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, ","Ko pangozayan o ngaran ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta a yamvavaga jinyo. Ji nyo nginara o icicirawat da no yaji manaralay a tao, ta o nakenakem da nira am yabo na peypeypangayan. "
1239230,"having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: ",Onowned da am yakmey kasarisaryan. Yabo da kasngesngenan do vayo a onowned a yapo ji Ama ta do to. So da ikanoyong a yaji macipayok so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to. 
1239231,"who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. ",Da jyatenngi o da kanigan a yato mangozangozay do nakem da yamapasagpyan so aktokto da.
1239232,But ye have not so learned Christ; ,Am abo o akman sang a nanao na ni Kizisto a nimamizing nyo. 
1239233,"if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: ","No kamo manoyong a yarana nimakamizing sya, yarana mangononong do manoyong a nanao na ni Yeso a ninanao namen jinyo am, "
1239234,"that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; ",karwan nyo na o adan a nakenakem nyo a yamngingit jinyo do peyraratenan nyo. 
1239235,and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; ,So alitan nyo na do adan a nakenakem nyo. 
1239236,"and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.",Pangozayan nyo o avayo a onowned nyo a kano icicirawat nyo a mapatwaw so apiya nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to.
1239237,"Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. ","Am ori o ji nyo na mangononongi so malas. O manoyong a ciring o patwawen nyo do akma nyoy kakteh do cinai, ta tamo mamimin a akma ney peyvongvongwan no kataotao ni Kizisto. "
1239238,"Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: ",No si meyoyaoya kamo am ji kamo na to meyraraten. Taosya o kato nyo pasdepan so araw a meyoyaoya. 
1239239,neither give place to the devil. ,Ta no si akman kamo sang am kalittan kamo a littan ni Satan.
1239240,"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. ","O nimangap so ahahapen no kakwa am ablisan na rana o panakawan na a kowyat na rana amyaw no velek na, makanakem so kapanidong na so makasi a tao. "
1239241,"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. ",Taosya o marahet a ciring a makowbot jinyo. Ta o makasidong so tao a kano ikapya no tao a ciring o patwawen nyo. Ta ori o ipakasidong nyo so omamizing so ciring nyo a tao. 
1239242,"And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. ","Ji nyo alavat o ikeyngen na no onowned no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to a vazay. Ta o Seyzi am yongkad na jinyo ni Ama ta do to, do kavyay na jinyo no makwa. "
1239243,"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: ",Ablisan nyo na o oyaoyyan nyo no kadwan jinyo. Ji nyo macizagzagi o icyatatao nyo a meyoyaoyan. Ji kamo na lololos a mangavay. Taosya rana o kapeyyan nyo sya do onowned nyo so pacioyyan nyo do tao. 
1239244,"and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.","O kapya nyo so nakenakem do kadwan jinyo. To nyongbowa o oyyan nyo no kadwan jinyo, akman si Ama ta do to a yatongbo so raraten nyo, do na kanimawakwak ninyo ni Kizisto."
1239245,"Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; ",No kamo manoyong a na tey kaglaw a anak na am inarahen nyo si Ama ta do to a tey yapya so nakenakem. 
1239246,"and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.","Patwawen nyo do icicirawat nyo o pangangasyan na ni Ama ta do to, akman si Yeso Kizisto a yamarilaw nyaten a yajingbeywan do inawan na nisomidong jyaten.

1239247,"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. ",Ji nyo pasngesngena o mangzakza kano pangagoman nyo. Ta o akman rana sang am no peyyanen do onowned ori a kapeynyagamo nya am tey marahet o akman sang. Ta akmey anak na rana inyo ni Ama ta do to.

1239248,"For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.",Ta o mangzakza kano mangagom a tao am ji na nalamozongan o akman sang ni Yeso Kizisto a kani Ama ta do to. Ta akma ney pahamahamahen pa o pangagoman na kani Ama ta do to.
1239249,Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. ,"Am ori o ji nyo litai do kadwan jinyo a manci no kapya no akman sang a vazay. Ta o akman rana sang so icicirawat a tao am amyan so oyaoyyan na nira ni Ama ta do to no makwa, do kaji da niomonotan do nanao na ni Ama ta do to. "
1239250,Be not ye therefore partakers with them. ,Ji kamo na macihza do akman sang a tao. 
1239251,"For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: ",Ta no kakwa am nimyan kamo do kasarisaryan a ji makateneng ji Ama ta do to. Am sicyaikwaya am kamo na macikaop ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. So yanyo iyan rana do kazngangan. Am ori o inaran nyo so icicirawat da no tao a yamakateneng rana do ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239252,(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) ,Ta o icicirawat no makateneng do ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am ji meylimoteng so onowned. Omonod do manoyong a ciring. Ji mapowzib so nakem do icyatatao. 
1239253,proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. ,Naknakmen nyo o kahap nyo so apiya vazay a isaray na ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. Ta ori o ahapen nyo. 
1239254,"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. ",Ji nyo nginara o marahet a vazay da no amyan do kasarisaryan a yameyraraten a tao. Ta apyapya o kapacimalag nyo so apya vazay nyo jira. Ta ori o ipakateneng da do marahet a vazay da. 
1239255,For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. ,No malavat o katamwadan da no akman sang a tao am tey macimanig. 
1239256,But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. ,O apiya icicirawat nyo am ori o ipakateneng da do marahet a vazay da no meyraraten a tao a kapamlis da rana. 
1239257,"Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.","Am ori o pancyan da nya, ""Kayokay rana yamitkeh a tao. Pamlis kamo na, yapa meyraraten. Ta cirain na inyo ni Kizisto."""
1239258,"See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, ",Am ori o apzatan nyo do icicirawat nyo. Ta ji nyo nginara o abo so pannaknakman a tao. Ta inarahen nyo sira o tey rako so pangasasnekan so icyatatao. 
1239259,"redeeming the time, because the days are evil. ",No to ngyan so sidongen a tao am sidongen nyo sira. Ta ji nyo painini. Ta aliket rana o ta iyan do karawan. 
1239260,"Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. ",Ji ta todabwabo so nakem. Ta katenngan ta o apya vazay a pahanhanan na jyaten ni Ama ta do to.
1239261,"And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; ","Ji ta todasaki, ta makararahet so tao o akman sang. Apyapya pa o kakza ta no Seyzi a tomalamozong nyaten. "
1239262,"speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; ",O isirisiring nyo so kadwan jinyo am yadomket do Seysyo a Anwanood ni Tawey a kano meyngongyod apo do onowned nyo a yanood nyo si Ama ta do to. Akman sang o peyyanen nyo do onowned nyo a ipasaray nyo si Ama ta do to. 
1239263,giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; ,"O kasaray nyo no makakaday a yana nitoro jinyo ni Ama ta do to, ta si Yeso Kizisto o manoyong a Panirsirngen ta."
1239264,submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.,"Masicyakanig kamo, akman so nakenakem nyo si Yeso Kizisto a yamanig nya."
1239265,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. ",Inyo rana a mavakes am amizngen nyo o kahanghangan nyo akman si Yeso Kizisto a yanyo amizngen a Panirsirngen ta. 
1239266,"For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. ","Ta o kahanghangan nyo rana a mahakay am mamanong ninyo, akman si Yeso Kizisto a yamamanong no yamraralay nya tao. Ta iya rana am mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato. So icyakma ney mapeykataotao jyaten ni Kizisto a yamraralay nya. "
1239267,"Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. ","Am ori o onotan nyo do kahanghangan nyo a mahakay an, akman jyaten a yaomonot ji Kizisto."
1239268,"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; ","Inyo rana mahakay am ikarilaw nyo o katovong nyo do vahay an, akman si Kizisto a marilaw nyaten a nimawakwak nyaten. "
1239269,"that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, ","O na peyvazayan jyaten ni Kizisto am na toda ji ngamoga jyaten a yaponged na ni Ama ta do to. Nivonas na o raraten ta a kayavayo na so onowned ta, do yata kahap so ciriciring na. "
1239270,"that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. ",O peypeypangayan no vazay na ni Kizisto am isaray na yaten a tey yapya a abwata so karatan do tangain na ni Ama ta do to.
1239271,So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. ,O mahakay rana am ikarilaw na o katovong na do vahay. To na peynara o aryarilaw na so kataotao na a marilaw no mavakes na. Ta o marilaw no mavakes na am marilaw no kataotao na. 
1239272,"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: ",Abo o tao a macioya do kataotao na. Ta peyveyveknen na akman si Kizisto a yaomzat jyaten. 
1239273,"for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. ",Ta yaten rana yamraralay nya tao am akma ney peyvongvongwan no kataotao na ni Kizisto. 
1239274,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. ","Am ori an, ""No myan rana so tao do mahakay am ji sira rana macivahay do inyapwan da, ta matarek rana sira kano kahanghangan na. So icyakma dey asa ka tao a meyyaven do vahay."""
1239275,This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. ,Ori rana am yatey makdeng ori a ciring a yadomket do Seysyo a na pehngehngain ji Kizisto a kano amraralay nya tao. 
1239276,"Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.",So icyakman nyo sang a mahakay a marilaw no katovong nyo do vahay. To nyo peynara do karilawan nyo no kataotao nyo o karilawan nyo nira. Am panadnaden nyo a mavakes o kahanghangan nyo.
1239277,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. ",Inyo rana kanakan am amizngen nyo o inyapwan nyo. Ta ori rana am iyangay ta amraralay ni Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. 
1239278,"Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. ","""Ikaglaw nyo a ikanig o inyapwan nyo. Ta ori o ipeypapya nyo a peypanokonokow na do karawan ni Ama ta do to do.""

1239279,"And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.",Inyo rana keynyapwanan da am ji nyo pasozya o anak nyo. Vavagan nyo sira no nanao ni Kizisto a ipeypararako nyo so nakem da.
1239280,"Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; ",Inyo rana lamlamsoy da am onotan nyo sira o lawpan nyo. Ikanig nyo sira. To nyo peynara o nakenakem nyo si Kizisto a mahap so vazay da no lawpan nyo. 
1239281,"not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; ","Beken a no mangay da citahen inyo no lawpan o ikakdeng nyo a mahap so vazay da. Ta omaing do kararalay nyo ni Ama ta do to o kasaray nyo a mahap so vazay da, do kakma nyoy kalamsoyan ni Kizisto. "
1239282,"with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: ","Ji nyo nginara sira o somoli so lawpan da tao. Manakem nyo o kakma nyoy mahap so vazay ni Ama ta do to, a omahap so vazay no lawpan. "
1239283,"knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. ",Manakem nyo o na kato mapeyyangangayan so tao ni Ama ta do to. Tana peylamsoin da am tana beken a lamlamsoy am na to palololwa do kapyapya no vazay na o yazaw na sya.
1239284,"And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.",Inyo rana yamapeylamsoy so tao a lawpan am makapya kamo so nakem jira an. Taosya o kateywara no oyyan nyo nira. Manakem nyo o kapeyyangay nyo a tao a italamozong no asa ka Panirsirngen ta do teyngato. Iya rana am peyyangangain na o tao a ikarilaw.
1239285,"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. ","Manga kakteh, oya rana am imanowji rana yako inanao jinyo. Inyo rana am ipeyhanhan nyo o rako a oyowyat no Panirsirngen ta a omzat jinyo. "
1239286,"Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. ","Ahapen nyo o akma nyoy voovoo a na nitoro ni Ama ta do to, ta ori o ipakaharag nyo si Satan no mangay na littan inyo. "
1239287,"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. ",Ta yaten rana am beken a ta macililiman do tao. Ta tamo macililiman ji Satan a kano aro a kalamsoyan na yatomalamozong no meyraraten a tao do karawan. 
1239288,"Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. ",Am ori o ahapan nyo so akma nyoy voovoo a nitoro ni Ama ta do to a ipaciliman nyo ji Satan a kano kalamsoyan na a yamlita jinyo. Ta ori o ipakaharag nyo sira. So to nyo meyyonongi rana ji da rana litai.
1239289,"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; ",Am ori o ipeytataziman nyo a mapeyyabtek so manoyong a nanao na ni Ama ta do to. Kalokalen nyo o apya icicirawat nyo a omaing ji Kizisto. 
1239290,and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; ,Akma nyoy tokap o kapeylimwang nyo no Mapasaray a Ciriciring a mapanop so tao ji Ama ta do to. 
1239291,"above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. ",O peyhanhanan nyo ni Kizisto am akma nyoy sirong a izazat nyo do akmey apoy a ilita na jinyo ni Satan. 
1239292,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: ",Ipeyhanhan nyo si Ama ta do to a mapatazadang jinyo. Ta akma nyoy sakop o kapatazadang na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. Peyyanen nyo do onowned nyo o Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Ta ori rana am akma nyoy cinalolot a nitoro na jinyo no Seyzi. 
1239293,"praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; ",Miminen nyo ori a ipeynozi ji Ama ta do to a kasidong na jinyo. Abo ji nyo meynozyan a tomala so Seyzi a meypalanginan ninyo. Ori o ipeytataziman nyo. Ji nyo amtadan o kapeynozi nyo no akma nyoy kakteh do cinai.
1239294,"and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, ","Ipeynozi nyo yaken an, katoro na nya jyaken ni Ama ta do to so ciriciring na ipangnanao ko. Ta ori o ji ko a mamai no ji da pa nipatwaw no kakwa a Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a ipeylimwang ko. "
1239295,"for which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.","Ori an, yako iyan do pamemtengan. So yako alitan ji Kizisto a yameylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na. Ori o peynozyan nyo nyaken a kaji ko macimamman no ciriciring na ipeylimwang ko. Ta ori o peypeypangayan no na nipamnekan jyaken."
1239296,"But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: ","Si Ticiko a kakteh ta do cinai a yamakdeng a yamahap so vazay na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta am cyaha, ta ipanci na jinyo o ko kapiya do jya. "
1239297,"whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.",Am ori o yako pasonsonan sya mangay a manci nya jinyo so namen kapiya do jya a kapait na pa so onowned nyo.
1239298,"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ","Inaoy no si itoro na ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto o ikapiya no onowned nyo, a kazagoman nyo a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to, a kapanta na ninyo so manoyong a pangangarilawan nyo, a kakdeng nyo na so nakem a meyhanhan nya. "
1239299,Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. Written from Rome unto the Ephesians by Tychicus.,Inaoy no si itoro na ni Ama ta do to o pangangarilawan na jinyo a yajyahayo a yamraralay ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta.
1239300,"Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: ",Yaken rana am si Pawlo ko a kani Timotay a lamlamsoy na ni Yeso Kizisto. Namen ipeyteygami inyo a yameyili do Veydipi a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to a yaomanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto a ka ninyo a panipanirsirngen do kyokay. 
1239301,"grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",Inaoy no si itoro na jinyo ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta o pangangarilawan na kano ikapiya no onowned nyo.
1239302,"I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, ",No ko manakem inyo am ko isaray inyo ji Ama ta do to. 
1239303,"always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, ",Yako masaray so onowned a meynozi ninyo. 
1239304,for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; ,Ta nimeycicinda no kakwa na kai sicyaikwaya o yanyo sidongan jyaken a yameylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239305,"being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: ",Ko anoyngan o na kapeyvazay do onowned nyo ni Ama ta do to icyakma ney kanapnapan a ovid. Jyabo kakavos no nya vazay na jinyo a mangay no si komavos o akman sya no si ipirwa pa mai si Yeso Kizisto.
1239306,"even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. ","Manoyong o kapaw ko ninyo. Ta tana ko na myan do pamemtengan sicyaikwaya, tana no kasaliway ko pa a macinekanekad no manoyong a Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am yabo nyo jya nisidongan jyaken a mahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to. "
1239307,"For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. ",Katenngan na ni Ama ta do to o karilaw ko ninyo no pangangarilawan na ni Yeso Kizisto do kapaw ko ninyo. So ikanoyong no nya ciring. 
1239308,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; ",O ko peynozyan ninyo am kaji na meypahahayan no pangangarilawan nyo a meypahagnat. Akman sang o teneteneng nyo a makapatak no makakaday a vazay. 
1239309,that ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; ,So ipakateneng nyo rana do ney yapiya na vazay. No si makman kamo sang am manoyong kamo na a ji meylimoteng so onowned a abo so karatan do araraw no ipirwa na mai ni Kizisto. 
1239310,"being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.",So ikasasaray nyo a mapeyvazay so apiya vazay do kowyat na jinyo ni Yeso Kizisto. Ta si makman kamo sang am azwazwain da rana si Ama ta do to no aro a tao.
1239311,"But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; ","Manga kakteh, ko kakdain inyo a makateneng jyaken a yamyan do pamemtengan. Cyaha, ta na ikapyapya a yasomidong jyaken a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. "
1239312,"so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places; ",Am ori o da ikaro no mamzat a tao do vahay no panirsirngen eya kano aro a tao do jya do Loma a yamamimin a yamakateneng jyaken a nipteng da do kahap ko so vazay na ni Yeso. 
1239313,"and many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.",Ta yada ikowyowyat so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to no akma tey kakteh do cinai a yajyanyahey a meylimwang no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to.
1239314,Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: ,Manoyong o keyyan no tatasa ka tao a manginanahet a meynenenet a meylimwang no ciriciring na ni Kizisto. Am amyan so tatasa ka tao a apiya so nakenakem a meylimwang nya. 
1239315,"the one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: ",Sira rana ya am sira mamimin a yamarilaw nyaken a yamakateneng jyaken a yana nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to a yamacinekanekad no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na. 
1239316,"but the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.","Am o yatatasa ka tao a yameylimwang ni Kizisto am yasomala o onowned da. Yada naknakmen o yada karapa do alalaw ko, do yako iyan do pamemtengan eya."
1239317,"What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. ","Am cinakongo na. Tana somala rana o onowned da am cyaha, ta si Kizisto o ipeylimwang da. Am ori o sarayan ko nya sicyaikwaya mangay no makwa. "
1239318,"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, ","Ta katenngan ko o kapakowbot da jyaken, do peynozyan nyo nyaken a kano sidongan na jyaken no Seyzi a nitovoy na jinyo ni Yeso Kizisto. "
1239319,"according to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.",Ko ipeyhanhan si Ama ta do to a somidong jyaken a mapeyvazay so isaray na vazay. Tana sicyaikwaya kano kakwa am meyyangay o kaji ko anyaheyan. Tana mavyay ko a tana mawakwak ko am jyabo kaji ko azwazwayan si Kizisto do kataotao ko a. 
1239320,"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. ","Ta o ko ikakman sang no nakenakem am si Yeso Kizisto o ney makdeng na a yako naknakmen. Si mawakwak ko am apyapya pa, ta ahapen na yaken a mangay a macitovong jya. "
1239321,"But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. ","Am no si mavyay ko pa am apiya pa, ta makapeyvazay ko pa. Am ko jyatenngi sicyaikwaya o ko pamnekan. "
1239322,"For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: ",Ko ikakza o ko kakaro rana do karawan a mangay a macilovot rana ji Kizisto. Ta abo rana o apyapyan pa kano nang. 
1239323,nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you. ,Am ko kapakanakem jinyo a yamakdekdeng pa a yako sidongen. 
1239324,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; ",Katenngan ko o kasidong ko jinyo. So ikanoyong nyo a ikataid ko do karawan a peypakatkaten so nakenakem a kano pasarain so onowned. 
1239325,that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.,"Am ori an, no si mangay ko pa jinyo do dang am jyabo kaji na rakorakwan pa no sarasaray nyo ji Yeso Kizisto, do kanisomidong na jyaken a meysinaoli pa jinyo."
1239326,"Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; ","O ahahapan nyo so onowned nyo do araraw am pehngehngain nyo do Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Kizisto an. Tana ji ko angay a tomita jinyo a kapakamizing ko jinyo a akmey asa so pangtoktwan a kano onowned a mowyat a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring, "
1239327,"and in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. ",a jyanyahey no macioya jinyo a tao. No si akman kamo sang am yongkad na no kapeygegcin na jira no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to a keyyan na no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad nyo. 
1239328,"For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; ","O na nipamnekan jinyo am beken a nyo kanoyong ji Kizisto an, ta ahapen nyo o alalaw na a mahap so vazay na, "
1239329,"having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.",akman so nimacita nyo rana do kataotao ko a kano nimamizing nyo. So yana to ngaii sicyaikwaya.
1239330,"If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, ","Manngwa, yanikarapa do onowned nyo o yanyo ipacikaop rana ji Kizisto an? Manngwa, yanikait jinyo o pangangarilawan na an? Manngwa, nyo katenngan o Seyzi a yasomidong jinyo an? Manngwa, nyo ikarilaw o kadwan jinyo an? "
1239331,"fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. ",No kamo nimeypahagnat am ko kakzeben inyo akmey yasa so anodan a kano pangangarilawan a kano nakenakem. Ta ori o ikanoyong ko na a somaray so onowned. 
1239332,Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. ,Ji nyo pakaranga o nakenakem nyo an. Ji nyo akzan o keynakem nyo a tao an. Ikanig nyo o kadwan jinyo an. Naknakmen nyo o keyyan no tao a apyapya pa ka ninyo an. 
1239333,"Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. ",Beken a o kataotao mo o manakem mo an. Ta manakem mo o kapanidong mo so icyatatao mo an. 
1239334,"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: ",Inarahen nyo si Yeso Kizisto an.
1239335,"who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: ",Ta si Yeso rana am Tao do to. Am na jyangai no nakem o kapeyyangay da kani Ama na a Tao do to.
1239336,"but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: ",Ta iya rana am na nipaveveh o na nyahapan sya a na kapyapya pa so na kakmey lamlamsoy a nimalikey a tao. So na icyakman jyaten a tao do karawan so kataotao.
1239337,"and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. ",Na pavevehen o kataotao na a omamizing si Ama na a mahap so vazay ni Ama na a mangay a mawakwak do jyojika.
1239338,"Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: ","Am ori an, nyazwazway na ni Ama ta do to si Yeso a kapanta na nya so ney mazway a ngaran na. O nitoro na jya a ngaran na am Panirsirngen."
1239339,"that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; ","Ori an, tana do teyngato a tana do teyrahem a tana mavyay a tao a tana nimawakwak rana am abwata o ji meylilitod do tangain na, "
1239340,"and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.",a manci ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen. So ikanoyong no azwazway a mangay ji Ama ta do to.
1239341,"Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. ","Manga kakteh, no kapacikaop ko pa jinyo am masangib kamo a omamizing jyaken. Am ori o ikakdekdeng nyo pa omahap so ciring ko do ikabo ko jinyo do dang an. Makapzat kamo an. Makowyowyat kamo a mahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to. Ta ori rana am manoyong a vazay no nimamlis so nakenakem a tao. "
1239342,For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. ,Ta yameyvazay do onowned nyo si Ama ta do to. So ikasasaray nyo a mapeyvazay so kakdain na jinyo ni Ama ta do to.
1239343,Do all things without murmurings and disputings: ,O makakaday a vazay nyo am ji nyo a ratan. Ji nyo a zyakan. 
1239344,"that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; ","So nyo ji meylimotengi so onowned a abo so karatan a akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to a yamacikaop do meyraraten a tao do karawan. Ta inyo rana am akma kamoy zezak da, akman so mata no hanit a amzezak so kasarisaryan, "
1239345,"holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. ",a kapakateneng da do ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a manta nira so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da. Ta no si akman kamo sang am amyan rana so kakownongan no zikzikna ko jinyo no si marateng o araraw no yai na ni Kizisto.
1239346,"Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. ","O raralayan nyo ni Ama ta do to am akmey nakem nyo a patanangen nyo jya. Tana wakwaken da rana yaken a pavoyogen so rala am cyaha, ta akmey nakem ko rana ori a patanangen ko ji Ama ta do to. So ko isaray, ta macizanod kamo jyaken a somaray. "
1239347,"For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.",Akman kamo sang an. No somaray kamo am manakem nyo yaken a macizanod jinyo a somaray an.
1239348,"But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. ",No si apyahen na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta am makeykai ko a tovoin si Timotay a mangay jinyo do dang. So ipakateneng ko do vazay nyo do dang. 
1239349,"For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. ",Ta iya ori o yamacizanod jyaken so onowned a yamanoyong a yamarilaw ninyo. 
1239350,"For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. ",O karwan no tao am o kataotao da o da naknakmen. Da jyanakem o vazay na ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1239351,"But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. ",Nyo katenngan o mina vazay na ni Timotay. Ta yanamen akmey meyyama a yamazikna a yameylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring. 
1239352,"Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. ",No si katenngan ko o araraw na no ipakowbot ko do pamemtengan eya am makeykai ko a tovoin si Timotay a mangay a tomita jinyo. 
1239353,But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. ,Ko anoyngan si Ama ta do to a makeykai rana tomovoy jyaken a mangay a tomita jinyo.
1239354,"Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. ","Ko naknakmen o katovoy ko so akma tey kakteh do cinai a si Ipaloti a mangay jinyo do dang. Ta iya rana am arako o nisidongan na jyaken do kanitomovoy nyo sya jyaken, do katey mowyat na a macipeyvazay jyaken. "
1239355,"For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. ",Yateywara o apapaw na jinyo. Na ikarahet no onowned o nyo kapakamizing sya yameyngen so kataotao. 
1239356,"For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. ",Manoyong o kanimeyngen na a toda jyangay so inawan. Am mina kasi na nyamen ni Ama ta do to. So ji ko nimazababi nya no onowned. 
1239357,"I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. ",Am ori o ko naknakman so kakeykai ko rana tomovoy sya do vahay da. So ikasasaray nyo a macikaop rana jya. So ikapyapya na rana no akman sang. 
1239358,Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: ,"Am ori an, isaray nyo a tomaotao sya, do nyo kakmey meyketeketeh do cinai. So kanigan nyo no akman sang a tao an. "
1239359,"because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.","Ta na kajyawakwakan rana, do yana kahap so vazay ni Kizisto a kano vazay nyo a yasomidong jyaken."
1239360,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.","O ney manowji a ciring ko jinyo akma koy kakteh do cinai am somaray kamo, ta kamo macikaop rana ji Kizisto. So yako papirwan pa so mina ciring ko jinyo no kakwa pa. Ta beken a ikarahet nyo, ta ipeypapya nyo ori."
1239361,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision. ",Azimanen nyo sira o meyraraten a tao a omalalas do nanao na ni Ama ta do to. Sira rana am tao do Yotay a yamanci no kayongkad do kataotao. 
1239362,"For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.","Ta yaten rana am manoyong a niyongkadan na rana ni Ama ta do to, do kasidong na jyaten no Seyzi a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to. So ta ji mangozai do makakaday a iwawalam da no tao do Yotay a mapeypapya jyaten do tangain na ni Ama ta do to, ta si Yeso Kizisto o ozain ta. Am ori o yata ikasaray rana a yamacikaop jya."
1239363,"Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: ",No myan so tao a manci no kapeypapya na no apya vazay na do tangain na ni Ama ta do to am apyapya ko pa manci no akman so sang. 
1239364,"circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; ","Kawao araw ko pa nimatazak a tao am niyongkadan da na yaken no iweywawalam ta. Ta manoyong ko a Isedi a tao a macitetngehan ji Penyaming. So ikanoyong ko a macikownongan do Sipolay a tao. No hapen ta do iwawalam ta tao do Yotay am makdekdeng ko pa a mangozay jya, do kapacitetngehan ko do tao a macyagom do Vadisay. "
1239365,"concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. ",No hapen ta do kakdekdeng ta no onowned am nimacivosoy ko rana do niomanoyong ji Yeso a tao. Am no si pangozayan ta o iwawalam na ni Moyse a cittan ta so kapyapya ta am jyabo karatan ko a. 
1239366,"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. ",Am o ipanci ko no kakwa apiya am ko rana nilikodan a ko kararalay ni Kizisto sicyaikwaya.
1239367,"Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, ","Beken a ori an. Ta yamaharahara rana o nakem ko ji Yeso Kizisto sicyararalay ko na nya. Yako ipanci o makakaday a vazay a yabwata so angangayan, do yako kapyapya pa so ko kapakateneng ji Kizisto a Panirsirngen ko. "
1239368,"and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: ",Ko manoyong a yamacikaop jya. So ko na peymakarwan do mina vazay ko no kakwa. So ikanoyong ko na abo so karatan do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. O yako icyakman sang am ko ipeyhanhan si Kizisto. Beken a ko kahap so iwawalam na ni Moyse. Ta yamanoyong ya nitoro ni Ama ta do to o ikapya ko do tangain na. 
1239369,"that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; ","Am ori o ko naknakman so ko kapakateneng ji Kizisto a kano arako a oyowyat na jyaken. Ta iya rana am tey mowyat, ta nimirwa a mavyay. Yako ikakza o ko kapacizanod jya so alalaw, akman sya ji rahet so kawakwak na. "
1239370,if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. ,Inaoy no si akman ko sang a mavyay a apo do heseb ko no makwa.
1239371,"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. ",O ko peycirngan sang am beken a ko rana nimimin a yamahap o yamakakaday a yamyan ji Ama ta do to. So ko ikakdekdeng pa yaominara si Yeso Kizisto do na katalamozong nyaken. 
1239372,"Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, ","Manga kakteh, ko ji naknakma o ko kanimakahap rana so sang. Ta yasa ka vazay o ko naknakmen. Ko na ji paolya o mata ko do mina vazay ko no kakwa. Ta ko na naknakmen o yako kahap so yaomanam a vazay. "
1239373,I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. ,"Am ori o ko icyakmey malayo a tao a yasomazap so ko angayan, do ko kanakenakem so ko kapakahap so azaw ko ji Ama ta do to a to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad. Ori rana am nipamnekan na yaken ni Ama ta do to a omanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto a kapakahap ko na sang. "
1239374,"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. ","Am ori o ikamimin ta yamakdeng so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to a makateneng do akman sang an. No si macitarek o nakenakem nyo am cyaha, ta si Ama ta do to o mapananao nya jinyo. "
1239375,"Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.",Am ji ta ablis so nakenakem a mangozay do manoyong a nanao a nimamizing ta.
1239376,"Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample. ","Inarahen nyo yaken, manga kakteh an. Panginginaran nyo sira o yaominara jyamen a tao an, ta yanamen rana nipacita jinyo o manoyong a icicirawat namen. "
1239377,"(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: ",Beken a ko ipisa inyo a yavavagan. So ko to lavii a yamapamizing jinyo an. O icicirawat da no aro a tao am yamacisala ji Kizisto a nimawakwak do jyojika. So da ikanoyong a akmey mapeykavosoyan si Yeso. 
1239378,"whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.) ",O mapeyvazay so sang a tao am mangay sira do kararatan. Ta o isovo da kanen o da naknakmen. Da azwazwain o yamacimanig a vazay. Da ji ngawawan o kasasaodan da do karawan. 
1239379,"For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: ",Am yaten rana am italamozong na yaten ni Ama ta do to. So pananalan ta si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta a meygegcin a apo do teyngato. Ta iya o mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato. 
1239380,"who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.",Pangozayan na do oyowyat na ipanod na so makakaday do sinokob no hanit a iblis na so kataotao ta do karawan. So icyakman takamo so kataotao na ni Yeso a maniray a ji rana wakwak.
1239381,"Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.","Am ori o ikakdeng nyo pa so onowned a meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to, manga keypong an. So ko sarayan ninyo a akma koy kakteh do cinai. Ta yamyan so kakownongan na no vazay ko jinyo. Inaoy no si macita ko pa inyo."
1239382,"I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. ",Inyo rana yararwa akma nameney kakteh do cinai a mavakes a meyngaran so Yoati a kani Sentihe am to nyo peykabobwa o raraten nyo do kadwan jinyo. 
1239383,"And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.",Imo rana mo kahakay a kararay ko am sidongen mo sira an.

1239384,"Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. ",Mangday kamo do araraw a somaray a yamacikaop ji Yeso. So papirwan ko pa sya ipanci jinyo an. Somaray kamo an.
1239385,Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. ,Manakem nyo o kapangarilaw nyo so tao an. Ta yana makeykai si Yeso a yamai. 
1239386,Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. ,Ji nyo a ratan o makakaday a vazay nyo an. Ta ipanci nyo do inozi nyo o kakzeben nyo ji Ama ta do to a kasaray nyo so onowned a mapasyasi jya an. 
1239387,"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.",Ta itoro na jinyo o ikapiya no onowned nyo a ji da tenngi no karwan no tao. Mangay na irapa do nakenakem nyo do nyo kararalay ni Yeso Kizisto.
1239388,"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. ","Am ori manga keypong an, ahapan nyo so apipiya vazay a isaray na ni Ama ta do to a kano ji meypareki so onowned a kano tey mazway a vazay. O akman rana sang am peyyanen nyo do onowned nyo a patwawen do icicirawat nyo. "
1239389,"Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.",O nimamizing nyo a kano nimacita nyo a icicirawat ko am miminen nyo a peyvazain an. Ta ori o ipacitovong na jinyo no yamanta nyaten so ikapiya no onowned ta a si Ama ta do to.
1239390,"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. ",Ko masaray do ko kararalay ni Yeso. Ta yapa mirwa o nakenakem nyo a yasomidong jyaken. So ko ipakateneng jinyo a yamasangib a yamnakenakem jyaken. Am na kabo no tao a yanyo pararan so aryarilaw nyo jyaken. 
1239391,"Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. ",O ko peycirngan so sang am beken a nyo kaji mapanadnadan jyaken. Ta ko rana mapeyneynara no abo o amyan do kataotao. 
1239392,"I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. ","Nimasapa ko rana o kakcinan ko, kabsoyan ko. Tana mabsoy ko a tana makcin ko a tana abo o kalahen ko am amyan rana so ko peyneynaran sya. "
1239393,I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. ,"Ta si Yeso Kizisto a yaomoyat jyaken am ori o ko ipakownong do ko ahahapan sya, do yameycyataretarek a ko masapa."
1239394,"Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. ",Am tey yapya o nisidongan nyo jyaken do alalaw ko. 
1239395,"Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. ",Naknakmen nyo a tao do Veydipi an. No ka ori pa so kapeylimwang ko no Mapasaray a Ciriciring am karwan ko o pongso do Maciton. No kano nang am sinjya nyo o nisomidong jyaken a mapatodeh jyaken. 
1239396,For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. ,No keyyan ko pa do Tesalonicya am beken a ipisa kamo a nisomidong jyaken. 
1239397,Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. ,Ji ko ngakzeba o kazaw nyo jyaken. Ta tey kakza ko ji Ama ta do to o karwaro na pa no isidong na jinyo do kapiya no nakenakem nyo jyaken. 
1239398,"But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. ",O nyo nyazaw jyaken a apzapzatan am ko na nimamimin a yanimahap. So ko to meypanpani jya. Si Ipaloti a akma tey kakteh am ori o yanimai no aro a azaw ko. So na sarayan nya ni Ama ta do to so akma nyoy nakem jya. 
1239399,But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. ,"Si Ama ta do to o tomoro no makakaday a apyahen nyo no nakem, ta kamo na macikaop ji Yeso Kizisto. Ta ji nyo a giji o kangangay na ni Ama ta do to a itoro na jinyo. "
1239400,Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.,Inaoy no azwazwain ta si Ama ta do to a mangay do kaidan no karawan. Amin.
1239401,Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. ,Ipeyminaminasi nyo sira o akma tey kakteh do cinai a yamraralay ni Yeso Kizisto. Akman sang sira o kararay ko a meyminaminasi ninyo.

1239407,"since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints, ",Ta namen rana nimamizing o nakenakem nyo si Yeso Kizisto a kano aryarilaw nyo so aro a sinjya. 
1239408,"for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; ",Ta no kavavayo nyo pa nimakamizing so Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am to nyo na nganoyngi o itoro na jinyo ni Ama ta do to do teyngato. 
1239409,"which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth: ","Beken a inyoo o na peylimwangan no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to, ta yarana nimeylimwang do peycyamahamahatawan na. So da rana ipamlis no tao. So da icyakman jinyo a yarana makateneng do pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to. "
1239410,"as ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; ",Nyo nimahap o pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to ji Ipava a kararay namen a yaji mapasaklang do vazay ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1239411,who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.,"Iya o nimanci nya jyamen so katey mangarilaw nyo so icyatatao nyo, do kaniomoyat na jinyo no Seyzi."
1239412,"For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; ",Mamizing namen inyo am masangib namen a meynozi ninyo. Ipeynozi namen o kapanta na ninyo no Seyzi so makakaday a teneteneng a makateneng do nisidongan na jinyo ni Ama ta do to a kano peypalanginan na ninyo. 
1239413,"that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; ","No si akman sang am manoyong kamo na macipayok so vazay ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta, do kahap nyo so vazay na a meypahagnat rana so onowned a makateneng rana ji Ama ta do to.

1239414,"strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; ",Ta iya rana am tey mowyat. So namen peyhanhanan nya a makasidong jinyo a jyamama no makakaday a alalaw a masaray rana so onowned. 
1239415,"giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: ",Isaray nyo si Ama ta do to. Ta iya o yanimapanop jinyo a yamraralay nya. So nyo ikanoyong rana yamyan do kazngangan. 
1239416,"who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: ",Na nyagag yaten do kasarisaryan a na kaparapong jyaten do italamozong no Anak na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239417,"in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:",Nyagag na yaten ni Yeso Kizisto do peyraratenan ta. So ta ikanoyong rana nimavonas so raraten.
1239418,"Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: ",Si Kizisto rana am akma ney kamamagenan ni Ama ta do to. So na ikanoyong ney manhama na do makakaday a nyamamaog na. 
1239419,"for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: ","Iya o nyamaogan na sya ni Ama ta do to so hanit a kano karawan a kano meycyamadadayan a yamacita kano yajyacita, pacyangayan no yajyacita so oyowyat a kalamsoyan ni Satan a kano tinsi na ni Ama ta do to.

1239420,"and he is before all things, and by him all things consist. ",Jya nimamaog pa o makakaday am amyan rana si Kizisto. So ika iya na no tomalamozong no yamakakaday. 
1239421,"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. ",Yaten rana a yamraralay nya am akma ney kataotao yaten ni Yeso Kizisto. So ika iya na no yameymatmatngeh nyaten. Iya o na yapwan no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta.

1239422,For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; ,Ta kakdain na ni Ama ta do to o Anak na macikto jya so kadmayan.

1239504,"And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost: ","Tana aro o alalaw nyo am kamo masaray a na sidongen no Seyzi a yamahap so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a yaominara si Yeso, akman jyamen a yajyamama no alalaw namen. "
1239505,so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. ,Am ori o da peycitacittan jinyo no yana omraralay ni Yeso Kizisto do Maciton a kado Akayya. 
1239506,"For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. ","So yana nikapo jinyo a yameylimwang no nanao na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. O nakenakem nyo si Ama ta do to am beken a do Maciton a kado Akayya o na nispowan, ta yanisompo do peycyeylilyan na. So ji namen mapakaroi so ciring namen an. "
1239507,"For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God; ",Ta yaro o tao a yamanci nya jyamen so kapiya no nitaotawwan nyo jyamen no kangay namen jinyo do dang a kano yanyo mina kakaro rana do yamalas a niraralay nyo a yarana omanod ji Ama ta do to a yaomraralay nya a yamanoyong a yamavyay a Tao do to. 
1239508,"and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.",So yanyo nanalan so Anak na si Yeso Kizisto a meygegcin a apo do teyngato. Si Yeso Kizisto am nivyay na ni Ama ta do to a nimapo do heseb na. Iya o yata pakahatasan so peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to no makwa.
1239509,"For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain: ","Manga kakteh, nyo katenngan an, ta no kangay namen jinyo do dang am apiya o vazay namen, ta aro o niomanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto a tao. "
1239510,"but even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention. ","Nyo katenngan an, ta no kaji namen angayan pa jinyo do dang am amyan rana so alalaw namen do kapeymetdeh da jyamen do Veydipi a ili. Am na mina kapanta nyamen so oyowyat ni Ama ta do to. So namen jyanyahei no meykamadadayan a da izazat jyamen a yameylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to jinyo. "
1239511,"For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile: ",Yabo o yamalas a nanao namen jinyo. Abo o nanao namen a ilita namen jinyo. 
1239512,"but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. ",Ta o yana nipamnekan jyamen ni Ama ta do to am na meypakemkemen jyamen o kapeylimwang namen no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na. Am ori o ji namen mapatareki so ipanci namen a komagkaglaw so icyatatao namen. Ta o makateneng do onowned no tao a Tao do to am iya ori o namen pasarain no vazay namen. 
1239513,"For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness: ",Nyo katenngan yamen a yaji manlita so tao no ciriciring namen. So na ikabo no yamarahet a aktokto namen. Ta si Ama ta do to am yongkad namen a manoyong so ipanci. 
1239514,"nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. ",Tana nipamnekan na yamen ni Kizisto a omlivolivon no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na am namen ji ngakdaya o kazwazway da jyamen no tao. So ji namen ngakdai jinyo a kano karwan no tao a zomwazway jyamen. 
1239515,"But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children: ","Am no kapacikaop namen pa jinyo am apiya namen so nakem jinyo, akman so inyapwan a mavakes a omazwazovo so minapodpod jya. "
1239516,"so being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us. ",Namen hapen do namen karilaw ninyo. Ori o namen sarayan no kapeylimwang namen nya jinyo no yanimapo ji Ama ta do to a Mapasaray a Ciriciring na. Mangay do inawan namen o namen ji beywani jinyo. Ta inyo rana am namen tey kaglaw.
1239517,"For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. ","Manga kakteh, naknakmen nyo o zikna namen do maraw a kano mahep an, do namen kalan so isovo namen a kanen. Ta namen ji myapya inyo a mazikna nyamen no isovo namen a kanen no kapeylimwang namen nya jinyo so Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. "
1239518,"Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe: ","No kapacikaop namen pa jinyo do dang am o ciriciring namen a kano icicirawat namen am apiya macita nyo. Abo o malas a vazay namen. Cyaha, ta inyo a kani Ama ta do to am yongkad no vazay namen ang. "
1239519,"as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children, ","Nyo katenngan o nakenakem namen jinyo. Ta yakman so inyapwan a mahakay a amvavaga do minapodpod jya, "
1239520,"that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.",a yajimtad a yamnanao jinyo a yamapait so onowned nyo a yamapadnadna so nakem nyo. So ikanoyong nyo a isaray na ni Ama ta do to. Na nipamnekan inyo a macizanod do oyowyat na kano azwazway na.
1239521,"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe. ","Namen masangib a yasomaray nya ji Ama ta do to. Ta o namen nipeylimwang a ciriciring na am nyo na nimamizing. Nyo na nimahap. So nyo ji mancii nya ciring no tao, ta nyo anoyngan ori a ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Ta o ciring ori am yaomoyat do onowned nyo a yarana omanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto."
1239522,"For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Jud&#230; a are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: ","Manga kakteh, o alalaw nyo a kano alalaw da no aro a kyokay do Yotay am alalaw da ori no omanod ji Ama ta do to a tao. Ta o iraherahet da jinyo no keylyan nyo am akman so sang o iraherahet da so aro a kyokay no tao do Yotay. "
1239523,"who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: ",Sira rana tao do Yotay am niwakwak da si Yeso a Panirsirngen ta kano aro a panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a da kavozwaw pa jyamehen. So da ikanoyong a yameyraraten do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. So icyakma dey kavosoyan no tao do karawan. 
1239524,"forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.",Yada zazaten yamen a yameylimwang no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a mapatazadang so beken a tao do Yotay. So da ikanoyong a yameyparo so yapeyraratenan a peydednan no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to.
1239525,"But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire. ","Manga kakteh, tana yapa jyownay o namen nikaro jinyo am namen ikapaw inyo. Tana namen ji macikaop jinyo am cyaha, ta yamacikaop jinyo o onowned namen. Inaoy no si mirwa namen pa makacita inyo. "
1239526,"Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us. ",Namen ikakza o namen kangay pa jinyo do dang. Ko masangib a yamnakenakem so yako kangay jinyo do dang am na kazazat jyamen ni Satan. 
1239527,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? ",Ta inyo o hanhan namen a yamapasaray jyamen. Si meygegcin si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta am sino o ipakazwazway namen no jya inyo. 
1239528,For ye are our glory and joy.,So ikanoyong nyo a pacikazwazwayan namen a isaray namen.
1239529,"Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone; ",Yabo o yasa ka ciring a yanamen nimamizing jinyo. Am ori o namen to ngyani rana do Yatyan eya. 
1239530,"and sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: ","Namen nitovoy o akma tey kakteh do cinai si Timotay a mangay jinyo do dang. Iya rana am kararay namen a mahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Kizisto. O namen nitovoyan sya am sidongen na inyo a komdeng so nakem a omraralay ni Ama ta do to, "
1239531,that no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto. ,a kaji da oniban so nakem no kadwan jinyo no peyrarehten da inyo. Ta kangay na ori no alalaw ta a omraralay ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1239532,"For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know. ",No kapacikaop namen pa jinyo asyo am nipanci namen rana jinyo o akman sang a alalaw. So na ipakaranes rana no alalaw nyo sicyaikwaya. 
1239533,"For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. ",Am ori o ko nitovoyan si Timotay a mangay jinyo. Ta ko ikasinalaw inyo. O ko nitovoyan sya am ipakateneng namen do nakenakem nyo si Ama ta do to. So namen ji nganoyngi jinyo a na nilittan rana ni Satan. Ta no si manoyong o akman sang am akma nameney jya ninanao inyo no kakwa pa.
1239534,"But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you: ",Sicyaikwa rana ya am yanimeysinaoli si Timotay a yanimapo jinyo. Na nipanci jyamen o nakenakem nyo si Ama ta do to a kano nyo pangarilawan so tao. Na ipanci jyamen o nyo kasangib a yamnakenakem jyamen a yamakza no kapakacita nyo jyamen. So nyo icyakman jyamen a yamapaw ninyo. 
1239535,"therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith: ","Am ori o namen jyavokahawi, manga keypong. Ta namen pangozayan o nakenakem nyo si Ama ta do to. "
1239536,"for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. ",No kamo to ngotokot so onowned ji Yeso a Panirsirngen ta am namen tongned so ninyakan. 
1239537,"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; ",Ori o sarayan namen ninyo ji Ama ta do to. Ta inyo o yamapasaray jyamen do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239538,"night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?",Tana maraw a tana mahep am yabo o namen ji meynozii ji Ama ta do to a amya jyamen a mangay tomita jinyo a mapait so onowned nyo.
1239539,"Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you. ",Inaoy si peypalanginan na yaten ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta a kangay namen rana jinyo do dang. 
1239540,"And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: ","Inaoy no si oyatan na inyo a meypahagnat so pangangarilawan a marilaw no kadwan jinyo, pacyangayan no karwan no tao, akman jyamen a yamarilaw ninyo. "
1239541,"to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.",Am ori o ikanoyong na ni Ama ta do to a mapakdeng so nakenakem nyo a omraralay nya. Ta no si meygegcin si Yeso a Panirsirngen ta kano niomraralay nya tao am manoyong kamo do tangain na ni Ama ta do to a ji meylimoteng so onowned a abo so karatan.
1239542,"Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more. ","Manga kakteh, nyo na nimahap jyamen o apiya icicirawat a isaray na ni Ama ta do to. Sicyaikwa rana ya am namen vavagan inyo no ngaran ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. Ta ori o ikowyowyat nyo paha a mahap so apiya vazay. "
1239543,For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.,Ta nyo na katenngan o ninanao namen jinyo apo ji Yeso a Panirsirngen ta.
1239544,"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: ",O nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to am kakzeben na o kazngang no onowned nyo. Ji na mamyapyan inyo a mangzakza so icyatatao nyo. 
1239545,that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; ,So ikamimin nyo a mahakay a makateneng do kabo no karatan nyo a mapasakay so kadwan nyo do vahay. Ji nyo to mangozai o onowned nyo. Ta ozain nyo si Ama ta do to an. 
1239546,"not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: ",So ji nyo mapasagpyani so kataotao nyo an. Ji kamo macyangangay do yato nazibo ni Ama ta do to. 
1239547,"that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. ",O akman rana sya vazay am taosya o kapasala nyo do akma nyoy kakteh do cinai an. Ta mangay o kaoya na no meyvazay so marahet a vazay ni Ama ta do to. Ori rana am nipaziman namen rana jinyo. 
1239548,"For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. ","O na nipamnekan jyaten ni Ama ta do to am beken a mangay ta pasagpyanen o kataotao ta, ta kakzeben na yaten a ji meylimoteng so onowned. "
1239549,"He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.","O ji ngahap so akman sang a nanao am beken a tao o na pasobnan, ta o Seyzi a nitoro na jyaten ni Ama ta do to am ori o pasobnan na."
1239550,But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. ,"O pasicyakarilawan nyo am tana ji namen mancyan do teygami am cyaha, ta amyan rana o nanao na ni Ama ta do to jinyo do kapasicyakarilawan nyo. "
1239551,"And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; ",Ko katenngan inyo a sinjya do Tesalonicya a yamarilaw no akma nyoy kakteh do cinai do Maciton. Am o namen pa ciring jinyo am makowyowyat kamo pa mahap so yapiya vazay ori an. 
1239552,"and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; ","Makapya kamo so onowned do kadwan jinyo an. Ji kamo manamwad an, ta makowyat kamo a amyaw no velek nyo an. Inarahen nyo o ninanao namen pa jinyo no kakwa an. "
1239553,"that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.",So ji nyo meyhanhani no icyatatao nyo a mapatodeh jinyo. So ikanoyong nyo a ikanig da no ji manaralay a tao.
1239554,"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. ","Manga kakteh, o nimawakwak rana tao am inaoy no si katenngan nyo o peypeypangayan na a kaji nyo na zababan so onowned. Ji nyo nginarai o yaji manaralay a tao a yaji makateneng do peypeypangayan na. "
1239555,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. ","Ta yata anoyngan si Yeso a nimawakwak a kapirwa na mavyay. Akman sang, ta yata anoyngan si Ama ta do to a mapeyvangon so omanoyong jya a nimawakwak a tao. No mirwa pa si Yeso a mai am macihza sira mai."
1239556,"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. ",Sicyaikwa rana ya am namen pangozayan o nanao na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta a manci nya jinyo. Yaten rana ya mavyay pa tao do ipeypanam na pa meygegcin ni Yeso am jyabo kapanmanma ta a kano nimawakwak a tao a mangay omrapong si Yeso a. 
1239557,"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: ",Ta no si marateng rana o araraw no nang am meygegcin si Yeso a tomawag jyaten a keyyan no panirsirngen no tinsi a manci nyaten. No mamizing ta o zapa do teyngato a ipatao na jyaten ni Ama ta do to am o niomanoyong ji Kizisto a nimawakwak rana tao am manomanoma sira mirwa a mavyay. 
1239558,"then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. ",Am yaten rana yamavyay pa am pehzahen na yaten jira a katkaten do cinalab a kapakacita ta na si Yeso do hanit. So ikanoyong ta a macitovong ji Yeso a mangay do kaidan no karawan. 
1239559,Wherefore comfort one another with these words.,Ahapen nyo o ciriciring eya a ipait nyo so onowned no kadwan jinyo a ipasaray nyo sira.
1239560,"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. ","Inyo rana akma koy kakteh do cinai am o ipakaranes no ipeygegcin ni Yeso am ji ko to mancyan jinyo do teygami ko, "
1239561,For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. ,"ta to nyo na tenngi. O araraw no ipeygegcin na ni Yeso am abwata o tao a makaziman sya, akman so tao a ji makaziman so manakaw do vahay da. "
1239562,"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. ","No si maniring o tao am, ""Cyaha, ta tanyo apiya,"" am jyakman sang, ta jyaziman o alalaw a makaranes a ombalinas sira, akman so meyrehrehmet a mavakes a ji rana makatayo do alalaw na."
1239563,"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. ","Am manga kakteh, beken a kamo amyan do kasarisaryan a ji makaziman so araraw no yai ni Yeso, akman so tao a ji makaziman so manakaw a tao do mahep. "
1239564,"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. ","Am inyo rana am kamo amyan rana do kazngangan, do nyo kapakaziman rana sya. "
1239565,"Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. ","Ori o ji ta to nginarai so karwan no tao a to ngitkeh, ta meytataziman ta. "
1239566,"For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. ",Ta o itkeh no tao am mahep. O ikasaki no tao am mahep. 
1239567,"But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. ",No ta manoyong amyan do kazngangan am meytataziman ta an. O nakenakem ta ji Ama ta do to a kano pangangarilawan na am akma tey sirong. Akma tey sakop o jyagonay a onowned ta a mapanala sya mahap jyaten do teyngato. So ikabo rana no oyaoyyan na nyaten. 
1239568,"For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, ",Ta o na nipamnekan jyaten ni Ama ta do to am beken a mangay na ioya nyaten. Ta ahapen na yaten do kapyapyan. Ori o mina vazay na no Anak na si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. 
1239569,"who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. ","O nikawakwak na ni Kizisto am ahapen na yaten do kapyapyan. Am ori an, tana do ta ika mavyay pa ya a tana do ikawakwak ta rana am no si mai si Yeso am macikaop ta na jya a mangay do kaidan no karawan. "
1239570,"Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.","Am ori o ipasipapait nyo a mapamizing so kadwan jinyo, akman so yapiya nyo ahahapan sya sicyaikwaya."
1239571,"And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; ",Namen ipacimeseseg jinyo manga kakteh am ikanig nyo pa sira o meyyapwaponged no kyokay a nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to. Ta sira rana am da vavagan inyo no icicirawat no omraralay ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1239572,and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. ,So karilawan nyo nira ahapen so vazay an. Makapiya kamo so nakenakem do kadwan jinyo an.
1239573,"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. ","Yanamen ipanci pa jinyo manga keypong am pazimanen nyo sira o malelma a tao an, a kapait nyo so mahayo so onowned a tao, kasidong nyo so jyakdeng so nakem ji Ama ta do to. Tana apiya so ahahapan sya, tana marahet so ahahapan sya tao am to nyo peyyangaya o nakenakem nyo sira. "
1239574,"See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. ",Azimanen nyo an. Ji nyo patonggali o macioya jinyo a tao an. O kapasicyakarilaw nyo. O tey kakza da vazay no icyatatao nyo am peyvazain nyo.
1239575,Rejoice evermore. ,O kasaray nyo.
1239576,Pray without ceasing. ,Ji kamo amtad a meynozi.
1239577,In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. ,"Tana apya, tana marahet o masapa nyo am o kasaray nyo ji Ama ta do to. Ta ori rana am nakenakem na jinyo ni Ama ta do to a omanod ji Yeso Kizisto a tao."
1239578,Quench not the Spirit. ,Ji nyo nengsengi o vazay no Seyzi. 
1239579,Despise not prophesyings. ,Ji nyo ngolala o ipanci da no meylimwang no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239580,Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. ,Am pakanaknakmen nyo o nimamizing nyo a nanao da jinyo a kownot nyo do manoyong a nanao an. 
1239581,Abstain from all appearance of evil.,Peymakarwan nyo o peyraratenan nyo do teyrahem.
1239582,And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. ,Ko ipeynozi inyo ji Ama ta do to a yamanta ninyo so apiya nakenakem nyo a kapzat na do onowned nyo a kano pahad nyo a kano kataotao nyo. So ikanoyong na amzat jinyo a kabo no karatan nyo a mangay do ikeypirwa na mai ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. 
1239583,"Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.",Si Ama ta do to rana a yanimamnek jinyo a omanoyong jya am yatey manoyong a makasidong jinyo.
1239584,"Brethren, pray for us.",Inyo akma nameney kakteh do cinai am ipeyneynozi nyo yamen an. 
1239585,Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. ,Masicyakarilaw kamo a meyminaminasi no kadwan jinyo. 
1239586,I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.,Yako pangozayan o ngaran na ni Yeso a manci no kavilang nyo do teygami ya a ipamizing nyo so akma nyoy kakteh do cinai.
1239587,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. The first epistle unto the Thessalonians was written from Athens.,Inaoy si itoro na ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta o pangangarilawan na jinyo.
1239588,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: ",Yaken rana am si Pawlo ko. Yamen rana sira Sila kani Timotay am namen ipeyteygami inyo a kyokay do Tesalonicya a yamacikaop rana ji Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto. 
1239589,"grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",Inaoy si itoro na o pangangarilawan na jinyo a kano ikapiya no onowned nyo ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta.
1239590,"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; ","Manga kakteh, namen mangday do araraw inyo a isaray ji Ama ta do to. So ikanoyong na no akman sang an. Ta yakamo meypahagnat so nakenakem do yanyo kapeypakdeng so aryarilaw so kadwan jinyo. "
1239591,so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: ,Am ori o namen azwazwayan jinyo do peycyakyokyokayan na a namen angayan. Tana yarako o alalaw nyo a da peyrarehten no tao do nyo kanod ji Yeso am yajyablis o nakenakem nyo an. Am ori o namen azwazwayan jinyo.
1239592,"which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer: ",So ikanoyong na no akman so sya a yongkad na no kaji na oyyan ninyo ni Ama ta do to. Ta o nakenakem na jinyo am macikasaray kamo jya do kanoyong nyo rana macikaop do italamozong na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239593,seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; ,"Manoyong o vazay na ni Ama ta do to, ta meydedna jira o alalaw da no yamapeyrarahet jinyo. "
1239594,"and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: ","Inyo rana a yakman jyamen a da peyrarehten am ji kamo alaw, ta balinasen na rana ni Ama ta do to o alalaw ta no si mai si Yeso a Panirsirngen ta a meygegcin apo do teyngato a maciralay do apoy a kano aro a mowyat a tinsi.

1239595,"who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; ",Am ori o pasyayan na sira do oyowyat na kano azwazway na. So ikanoyong da peydednan na no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to a mangay do kaidan no karawan. 
1239596,"when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.","O araraw na no ipeygegcin na am mamimin sira omanoyong jya tao a omazwazway sya a somaray nya. Inyo rana am macyangay kamo do dang, ta nyo anoyngan o nipeylimwang namen jinyo a ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to."
1239597,"Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power: ","Am ori o namen ikasangib a meynozi ninyo. So ipacimangno na no nakem na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. Inaoy si itoro na o oyowyat na a isidong na jinyo. So ipakateneng nyo jya a omonot do apyahen na vazay ni Ama ta do to. Ta na sidongen inyo, do nyo kapeyhanhan nya. "
1239598,"that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.",No akman kamo sang am ikazway no ngaran na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. So ipacikazway nyo jya. O kapwan no nang am apo do pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta.
1239599,"Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, ","No si mirwa mai si Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta no malovot ta amrapong sya manga kakteh am namen kakdain inyo, "
1239600,"that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. ","ji kamo tey makeykai a marahet nya so nakenakem no mamizing nyo o ipanci da no mangononong so malas do mina kapakaranes na rana no araraw na ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta.

1239601,"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; ","ji nyo to nganoyngi o ciring da an.

"
1239602,"who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. ",Iya rana am ioya na sira o tao a ji raralay nya. Ta abneken na o kataotao na makarakarang pa kano iraralay da no tao. So yangay na omlisna do raralayan da ni Ama ta do to a mapakataotao do to.
1239603,"Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? ","Manngwa, nyo na jyanakem o akman so sya a mina ciring ko pa jinyo no kapacikaop ko pa jinyo asyo? "
1239604,And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time. ,Nyo katenngan o keyyan no amzazat do tao a irako na so raraten a italamozong na ni Satan. Am amyan so araraw no nang a ipeytotwaw na. 
1239605,"For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. ","Ta yana papwen o na kapeyvazay no irako na so raraten a italamozong na ni Satan a tao. Am ji pa meyngongyod o vazay na, ta zazazzatan no mowyowyat pa ka nya. Am no si peylisen na rana o lima no yamzazat do vazay eya am, "
1239606,"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: ",ori o ipeytotwaw na rana no tao a italamozong na ni Satan. No si mai si Yeso am ahahan na kazakat na rana kabwata na rana no oyowyat na ipeyzavozavoz na so tao. 
1239607,"even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, ","Ta no kapeyigegen na pa no irako na so raraten a tao am oyatan ni Satan a mai a kapeyvazay na so mapangyangyalak a vazay. So icyakma ney mowyat. Am jyanoyong ori, "
1239608,"and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. ","kalita na do ji manganoyong a tao no meykamadadayan a vazay, ta ji da ngahapa o manoyong a nanao na ni Ama ta do to a manta nira so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da. "
1239609,"And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: ",Am ori o to na macyozai rana jira ni Ama ta do to do malas a nakenakem a omanoyong do malas a nanao. 
1239610,"that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.",O ji nganoyong do manoyong a nanao a makza no raraten da am mamimin sira peydednan no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to.
1239611,"But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: ",Inyo rana manga kakteh a na ikarilaw ni Ama ta do to am namen masangib inyo a isaray ji Ama ta do to. Ta no kaji na pa amaogan no karawan am nipamnekan na rana inyo ni Ama ta do to a ahapen. So nyavaywan na so onowned nyo no Seyzi a kowyat na jinyo a omanoyong do nanao na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239612,"whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. ",O Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a nipamizing namen jinyo am ori o yanimrara jinyo a macikasaray do azwazway na ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. 
1239613,"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. ","Ori an manga kakteh an, makakdeng kamo so nakenakem an. O ninanao namen jinyo a ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am meyyangay ori a kano ciriciring namen do teygami a miminen nyo a ahapen."
1239614,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, ",Na ikarilaw yaten ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. O pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to am ori o yapwan no to meyyonong a sarasaray no onowned ta amnanala so nakem na jyaten. 
1239615,"comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.",Inaoy no si pasarain na o onowned nyo a kapait na jinyo a jyablis so nakenakem a mapeyvazay so meykamadadayan a apiya vazay a kapanci nyo no apiya ciriciring.
1239616,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: ",Imanowji na ko ipanci jinyo manga kakteh am ipeyneynozi nyo yamen a kakeykai na no ciriciring na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta a meylimwang a kanoyong da jya no tao akman jinyo a omanoyong rana jya. 
1239617,and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.,Meynozi kamo ji Ama ta do to a kapahawa na jyamen do meyraraten a tao. Ta beken a todamimin o tao a yaomanoyong ji Yeso. 
1239618,"But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil. ",Am yabo na kalalasan ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta. Iya rana am ikakoyapet nyo so nakenakem a kaji na makagogadan jinyo ni Satan. 
1239619,"And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you. ",Namen ipeyhanhan inyo a sidongen na ni Yeso. Namen katenngan inyo a yajimtad a mapeyvazay so ninanao namen jinyo. 
1239620,"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.",Inaoy no ipeypalanginan na inyo ni Yeso a kapeypahagnat nyo so nakenakem a makateneng do karilawan na ninyo ni Ama ta do to. So ikanoyong nyo a ominara si Kizisto a tongbo so alalaw na.
1239621,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. ","Manga kakteh, namen pangozayan o ngaran ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta a manci nya jinyo. Ji nyo nganopa sira o akma tey kakteh do cinai a abwata so vazavazay a yaji ngahap so nanao namen jinyo. "
1239622,For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; ,Jyabo nyo kaji makatenngan jyamen a inarahen a. Ta no keyyan namen pa jinyo do dang am jyabo kanimalma namen a. 
1239623,"neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you: ",Ji namen nimacyakakan do karwan no tao. Tana maraw a tana mahep am mangday kapeyvazay namen a omyaw no velek namen do kaji namen mamyapyan ninyo a masanga nyamen. 
1239624,"not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us. ","O ikakman namen sang am beken a ikamo namen inyo a mapatodeh jyamen, am kapakanakem namen so kapeycitacita nyo jyamen a inarahen. "
1239625,"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. ",No keyyan namen pa jinyo do dang asyo am nipaziman namen rana jinyo o kaji nyo mapakanan so abo so vazavazay a tao. 
1239626,"For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. ",O peycirngan namen so akman sang am nimamizing namen o tatasa jinyo a to meyyowyaw a abo so vazavazay a kapanazovaz so icyatatao da. 
1239627,"Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. ",O akman rana sang a tao am pangozayan namen o ngaran ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta a mapaziman sira. So ikowyowyat da pa a meyvazay a omyaw no velek da. Ji sira to manazovaz so icyatatao da.
1239628,"But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing. ","Manga kakteh, ji nyo macimazai o kapeyvazay nyo so apipiya vazay."
1239629,"And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. ",Ala amyan so tao a to nazibo no ciring namen do teygami. Am o akman rana sang a tao am azimanen nyo an. Ji kamo maciwalam jya an a kasnek na. 
1239630,"Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. ","Am ji nyo abneka a kavosoyan nyo, ta kavavaga nyo jya akman so kakteh nyo do cinai."
1239631,Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.,Inaoy no si mangday na itoro jinyo o ikapiya no onowned nyo ni Yeso Kizisto. Ta iya rana am kapwan no ikapiya ta no onowned. Inaoy no si macitovong jinyo si Yeso Kizisto.
1239632,"The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. ",Ko vatvatkan o ngaran ko an. Yaken rana am si Pawlo ko a yameyminaminasi ninyo. Yamamimin o teygami ko a yako padketan so aryarilaw ko jinyo. So na ikanoyong no teygami ya a yapo jyaken.
1239633,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. The second epistle to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.,Inaoy no si itoro na ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta o pangangarilawan na jinyo.
1239634,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; ",Yaken rana am si Pawlo ko a lamlamsoy ni Ama ta do to a manoyong a mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato. Yana nipamnekan yaken ni Yeso Kizisto a omlivolivon no ciriciring na. So ikanoyong na ni Yeso Kizisto a hanhan ta. 
1239635,"unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.","Ko ipeyteygami imo, mo Timotay, akma koy manganak do ta kapeyyangay a omanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto. Inaoy no si itoro na jimo ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto o pangangarilawan na kano pangangasyan na kano ikapiya no onowned mo."
1239636,"As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, ",Apyapya kato mo ngyanan do Ivoso akman so mina ciring ko jimo no kapeypangay ko do Maciton a omzazat do yameylimwang no malas a nanao. 
1239637,"neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do. ",Ta peymakarwan da rana o abo so angangayan a kavavatanen a kano katatapilan no ineynapo da a ononongan da. Ta o akman rana sang am mapeyliliman. So ji na makasidongi so tao a makateneng do vazay na ni Ama ta do to. Ta no anoyngan ta am ori o ipakateneng ta jya. 
1239638,"Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: ",O agagazan no akman sang a ciriciring ko am ko kakzeben o kapakateneng da do pangangasyan da so tao apo do ji meylimoteng a onowned da a manoyong a meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to. So ikabo na no vazay da a somala do nakenakem da. 
1239639,from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; ,Ta yamyan so tao a yaji ngonot jya. So da ikanoyong a yanisomala do manoyong a nanao a da kaononong do abo so peypeypangayan a ciriciring da. 
1239640,"desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.",Da naknakmen o kapangnanao da no iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to a nitaid na ji Moyse. Am da jyatenngi o da ipanci a kano imakdeng na ipangnanao.
1239641,"But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; ","Katenngan ta an, ta no apiya o ahapan ta so iwawalam ni Moyse am jyabo kaji na apyan no nang a. "
1239642,"knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, ","Am ori o naknakman ta sya an. Ta o iwawalam rana ni Moyse am beken a isidong so apya so nakenakem a tao an. Ta o marahet so nakenakem am ori o cinamaog na a izazat do marahet a vazay da.

1239643,"for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; ","mangzakza so icyatatao, mangzakza so kehngehngay na so kolit, manakaw so kanakan, manlita, mangononong so malas, jyanoyong so ipanci do pacicicyan a kano mapasala do manoyong a nanao. "
1239644,"according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.",O manoyong a pangozayan a ciring am yapo do Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a somidong jyaten. Am ori o azwazwayan ta si Ama ta do to an. So na ikanoyong no nang a yako ipeylimwang a ciriciring.
1239645,"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; ",Ko tey saray ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. Ta nipanta na yaken so oyowyat ko a meylimwang nya. Ta na ji ngolala yaken. Ori na nipamnekan jyaken a mahap so vazay na. 
1239646,"who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. ","Am tana niraherahet ko si Yeso no kakwa pa a kapakakasi ko sira pasnesneken so omanoyong jya am na ikarilaw yaken ni Ama ta do to, ta no kanang am ji ko nganoyngi pa si Yeso. So ji ko makatenngi do vazay ko. "
1239647,And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. ,"O Panirsirngen ta rana si Yeso Kizisto am yatey rako o pangangarilawan na a na nitoro jyaken a na kapanta pa nyaken so onowned ko a meyhanhan nya kano pangangarilawan ko so icyatatao ko, ta yako macikaop rana jya."
1239648,"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. ",Yamanoyong o ciring eya an. Inaoy no si mamimin o tao a omahap so sya. Nimai si Yeso Kizisto do teyrahem a mahap so meyraraten a tao. Yaken rana am ney rako o raraten ko. 
1239649,"Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. ","Am kanikasi na nyaken ni Ama ta do to. Ta si Yeso Kizisto am manoyong a nimapapalit do nakenakem ko a meyraraten a tao. Na jyahaywan yaken a tey rako so raraten a tao.

1239650,"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.",Inaoy no to ta meyyonong a omazwazway si Ama ta do to a Panirsirngen ta. Ta iya rana am jyawakwak a jyacita a meyngongyod a Tao do to. Amin.
1239651,"This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; ","Manganako, mo Timotay, ko pakoyokoin pa jimo am ji ka onib so onowned an. Si myan so somengseng do ipeylimwang mo a ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am naknakmen mo o mina kapamnek da jimo no kararay ta a meyvazay ji Ama ta do to. "
1239652,"holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: ",So peyhanhanan mo ni Yeso a kahap mo so apiya nakenakem mo. Ta amyan so tao a mapasala so nakenakem da. Am ori o ikatarek na no anoyngan da. 
1239653,"of whom is Hymen&#230; us and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.","O akman rana sang a tao am si Siminay a kani Yadisanta. So ko na nitorwan nira ji Satan a italamozong na, ta ori pa o ipakateneng da do apya, kaji da na rehrehtan si Ama ta do to."
1239654,"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; ",O yamanma pa yako inanao jinyo am ipeynozi nyo o tao do karawan ji Ama ta do to. Ipasyasi nyo ji Ama ta do to a kasidong na sira. So ji ta hamangi no kasaray ta no aryarilaw na jyaten. 
1239655,"for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. ","Ipeynozi nyo sira o kabtekan nyo a panirsirngen do teyrahem a kano aro a panipanirsirngen do peycyeylilyan na. Ipeynozi nyo sira a kateneng da tomalamozong no pongso da. Ta ori o ikapiya takamo do keymiminili ta, ji meyrahet so nakenakem. "
1239656,For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; ,"O akman rana sang am tey yapya, ta tey kakza na o akman sang ni Ama ta do to. Iya o mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato. "
1239657,"who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.","Ta na ikakza o na kasidong so tao do karawan, kapakateneng da do manoyong a nanao. "
1239658,"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; ",O manoyong rana a nanao am asa si Ama ta do to. Asa o yamapanop jyaten ji Ama ta do to. Iya rana am si Yeso Kizisto do mina katazak na tao do teyrahem. 
1239659,"who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. ","Apyapyahen na pa o kataotao na a mawakwak, a omalit do oyaoyyan na nyaten ni Ama ta do to a meyraraten a tao.

1239661,"I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. ",Inaoy no si katenngan da no kamahakayan do peycyakyokyokayan na o kapeyneynozi da a ji rana meylimoteng so onowned a ji oyaoyahen a ji maciskaskadan. 
1239662,"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; ",O mavakes rana am ko kakzeben sira ji mapakazwazway no ayob da.

1239664,Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. ,"O mavakes rana am ji sira meyzezyak, ta kapangamizing da so inanao da sira. "
1239665,"But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. ",Ko ji mya o mavakes a mangnanao so tao do kyokay a tomalamozong no mahakay. Ta ko kakzeben o kaji da makazyazyakan.

1239668,"Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.","Am o mangahanas rana mavakes am apzatan na sira ni Ama ta do to no si jyablis o nakenakem da si Ama ta do to a mangarilaw so tao, ji meylimoteng so onowned, apiya so vazay."
1239669,"This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. ",No myan so tao a amnakenakem so katalamozong na no kyokay am apiya o akman sang a vazay an. So ikanoyong no akman sang a ciring an.

1239671,"not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; ","jyasaki, ji macililiman, apiya o nakenakem so icyatatao, ji mangamkam so nizpi. "
1239672,"one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; ",O vazay na rana do vahay da am pakapyahen na a makatalamozong no katovong na do vahay a kananao na so minapodpod jya. Ta ori o amizngen da so nanao na no minapodpod jya. 
1239673,"(for if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) ",Ta no ji na tenngi o vazay na do vahay da am jyabo kapakatalamozong na no kyokay a.
1239674,"Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. ","O tomalamozong no kyokay am taosya o kapahanhan so vayo pa omanoyong ji Yeso an. Ta ala mapakarakarang sira so nakenakem akman si Satan a nikaoya na ni Ama ta do to, do kapakakarakarang na so nakenakem. "
1239675,Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. ,"O makdeng pa am apzatan na o icicirawat na do tangain da no ji pa nganoyong ji Yeso a tao, ta si marahet o vazay na am matamwad do katalamozong na nya ni Satan."
1239676,"Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; ","O somidong rana so tomalamozong no kyokay a tao am akman sang, ta apiya o icicirawat da. So ji da mangononongi so malas a ciriciring. Jyasakisakin. Beken a nizpi o manakem da. "
1239677,holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. ,Ney yapya na am ji meylimoteng o onowned da omanoyong do nanao ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1239678,"And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. ",Am citahen pa o icicirawat da. No si abo o karatan da am apya rana o kahap da so vazay do kyokay.
1239679,"Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. ",O katovong da do vahay a mavakes am apiya o icicirawat da. Ji sira manamwadan. Taosya o kapangalalas da no makakaday a vazay.
1239680,"Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. ","O somidong so tomalamozong no kyokay a mahakay am asa o katovong da do vahay an. Akman sang o minapodpod jira, ta katenngan da nanawen. So ikapiya no kavavahay da. "
1239681,"For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.",No apya o sidongan da so vazay da no tomalamozong no kyokay am admain da rana sira no icyatatao da a kaji da rana mogawan a mangononong so nanao ni Yeso Kizisto a ipeylimwang do icyatatao da.
1239682,"These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: ",No kavatvatek ko do teygami ya am to ko naknakma o kakeykai ko a mangay tomita jinyo. 
1239683,"But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. ","Am no si kahahay ko am cyaha, ta to ko na mancyan jinyo do teygami ko o iwawalam ta.

1239684,"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.","Yata katenngan an, o makdeng a nanao a nipatwaw ni Ama ta do to a yata anoyngan.

So nikatkatan na sya ni Ama ta do to a yangay do teyngato."
1239685,"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; ",Nipaziman na rana no Seyzi o keyyan no tao no makwa a tomaosya so manoyong a nanao a kahap da so malas a nanao no kalamsoyan ni Satan. 
1239686,speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; ,O somala a nanao am apo do manlita tao. Sira rana am abwata rana o apya nakenakem da a somengseng do marahet a vazay. 
1239687,"forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. ","Ipanci da o macivahavahay a kano mapasakay yamalas, a kapanci da no kaji nganan so karwan no kanekanen. Am o kanekanen rana am nyamamaog na ni Ama ta do to. So sarayan da nya kakan da rana sya no omanoyong ji Yeso a kano makateneng do ciriciring na. "
1239688,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: ",O na nyamamaog rana ni Ama ta do to am yamamimin a yabo so karatan. Am ori o sarayan ta nya do onowned ta. So ji tanyo meyraci jya an. 
1239689,for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.,Ta o ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a kano inozi ta somaray nya jya am ori o ikabo na rana no marahet do kanekanen ta.
1239690,"If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. ","No si vahangsowen mo o aro a vazay eya do akma moy kakteh do cinai am manoyong ka lamlamsoy ni Yeso Kizisto, do kakdeng no nakenakem mo a mapeyvazay so manoyong a nanao ni Ama ta do to a yameypahagnat so onowned rana ji Ama ta do to. "
1239691,"But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness. ",Ji mo pasngesngena o abo so peypeypangayan a katatapilan nyo a ipanci. Ta apyapya pa o kowyat mo a meypahagnat so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to. 
1239692,"For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. ",Manoyong kapya na no mapazigton so kataotao am makdekdeng pa o kapeypahagnat ta so nakenakem ji Ama ta do to. Ta ori o makasidong jyaten sicyaikwaya kano makwa no myan ta na do teyngato. 
1239693,This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. ,Manoyong o akman rana sang a ciring. So ikamimin ta mahap sya an. 
1239694,"For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.",O yata ikowyat a yamahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to am ta ipeyhanhan si Ama ta do to a mapatazadang jyaten. Ta iya rana am to meyyonong a mavyay a Tao do to. Am o meyhanhan nya o avyain na.
1239695,These things command and teach. ,So pancyan mo no akman sang a vazay a kananao mo so kararay mo. 
1239696,"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. ","Tana malavayo ka am apzatan mo o ciriciring mo a kano icicirawat mo a kano pangangarilawan mo so icyatatao mo. Akman sang o onowned mo.

1239697,"Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. ",So ji mo amtaji no kapeyvilang mo so Seysyo do kalwalovotan a kapeylimwang mo nya inanao sira. 
1239698,"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. ","Ji mo to nazibwan o oyowyat na jimo no Seyzi a tomalamozong no kyokay.

1239699,Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. ,O akman rana sang a vazay am makowyat ka mapeyvazay sya an. Ta ori o ipakacita da jimo a nimeypakatkat rana. 
1239700,"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.",Meypepzat ka so kataotao an.

1239703,Honour widows that are widows indeed. ,O vao rana mavakes a abo so mapeylamnay sira am peyveyveknen nyo sira an. 
1239704,"But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God. ",No myan so anak da no vao a mavakes a kano apwapo da am nanawen mo sira do vahay da mapeylamnay so inyapwan da kano akes da kano akay da. Ta ikakza na o akman sang ni Ama ta do to. 
1239705,"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. ",O vao a mavakes rana abwata so mapeylamnay sya am ipeyhanhan na si Ama ta do to kapangday na meynozi do maraw a kano mahep a mapasyasi jya somidong sya. 
1239706,But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. ,Am o makza no keylamnay da tao do karawan am tana mavyay o kataotao da am akmey nimawakwak o onowned da. 
1239707,"And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless. ","Ipanci mo jira do omanoyong ji Yeso o akman sang a nanao, ta ori o ikabo no tao a omraherahet sira. "
1239708,"But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. ",No myan so tao a ji rana makanakem so zipos na kano kavavahay da am peymakarwan na o nanao ni Yeso. So ikaraherahet na pa kano ji nganoyong ji Ama ta do to.
1239709,"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, ",O padketen a vao a mavakes so ngaran a azawen no kyokay am sikanem (60) o kakawakawan na. Ipisa nimacivahavahay. 
1239710,"well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work. ","Katenngan da no tao apya so vazay, makananao so anak na, mateneng a manaotao so apo do teysa ka ili a tao. Ji mapahama so nakenakem, kasidong na so amyan so alalaw a tao a kowyat na mahap so apya vazay."
1239711,"But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; ","O malavayo pa vao a mavakes am ji da padketa pa o ngaran da, ta no si naknakmen da pa o kapacivahavahay da am aryan da na o kapeyvazay da ji Yeso Kizisto. "
1239712,"having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. ","So iyan na no raraten da, ta ji da hap o mina ciring da no kakwa pa a manci no kahap da so vazay na ni Yeso. "
1239713,"And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. ","Sira rana am kalivolivon da meyyowyaw a abwata so vazavazay. O maraherahet pa vazay da am ikazyak da o beken a vazay da, kapeygamogamo da no marahet a ciriciring. "
1239714,"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. ",Am ori o ko apyapyan so malavayo a vao a mavakes a mirwa pa macivahavahay a mangahanas a kapeyveyveken da so kavavahay da.

1239721,"I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. ",Yako myan do tangain na ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto a kano tinsi a yamanci nya jimo. So hapan mo so nanao eya an. No si myan so pacicin mo am amizngen mo o manoyong.

1239725,Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.,Akman sang o tao a apya so vazay am katenngan ori. Am tana jyatenngi am abo makatayo sya.
1239726,"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. ",Omraralay ni Yeso a peylamsoin da am amizngen da o mapeylamsoy sira tao an. Ta ori o ji da rehrehci so ngaran na ni Ama ta do to a kano nanao na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239727,"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.",No si iraralay na si Yeso no mapeylamsoy jinyo a tao am ji nyo akwan a lamlamsoy da o kapeykakteh nyo sira do cinai. Ta ikowyowyat nyo pa somidong so vazay da.

1239730,"perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself. ",Ta ori o yapwan no kato da mangamaogan so malas a nakenakem a kano marahet a icicirawat da. O nakenakem da nira omraralay ni Ama ta do to am naknakmen da o kapeynizpi da nya.
1239731,But godliness with contentment is great gain. ,Manoyong o katey yapya no omahap so vazay na ni Ama ta do to am tana abo nizpi am masaray an. 
1239732,"For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. ",Matazak a tao ta do karawan am abwata o nipalolo ta an. Am si karwan ta rana o karawan eya am abo o palolwen taha.

1239735,"For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.",O makza rana no nizpi am yapwan na no meycyamadadayan a raraten na.

1239863,"For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. ",Yaten rana no kakwa pa am abwata o katatenngan ta a ji mangamizing a akmey mavozaw pa so aktokto a to mangozangozay do onowned ta a makza no meycyamadadayan do karawan.

1239864,"But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, ",O ipakateneng ta do pangangarilawan na kano pangangasyan na ni Ama ta do to am 
1239865,"not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; ","na patazadangen yaten do teyngato, do na karilaw nyaten.

1239867,"that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

So ikanoyong ta mapananala so kapakahap ta rana so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta. "
1239868,"This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. ","So ikabo no kalalasan no ciriciring eya.

1239869,"But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. ",Am ji mo pasngena o kapacinekanekad da a macivaivait no iwawalam na ni Moyse a kano katatapilan nyo. Ta o akman rana sang am abo o peypeypangayan no akman sang.

1239871,"knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.","Katenngan nyo an, ta o akman rana sang a tao am peymakarwan da o nanao na ni Ama ta do to. O yongkad no kalasan da am raraten da."
1239872,"When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.

1239875,"All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.","Da ipeyminaminasi imo no kararay ko do jya.

1239880,"hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; ",Ta ko mamizing o pangasyan mo so akma tey kakteh do cinai a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to a kano nakenakem mo ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. 
1239881,that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. ,"Ko ipeynozi ji Ama ta do to o kapeyraporapong na jyaten do yata kakmey yasa a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to. So ipakateneng ta do makakaday a apya vazay a mamimin a apo ji Kizisto, do yata kapeyhanhan ni Kizisto a yasomidong jyaten. "
1239882,"For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.","O pangangarilawan mo, mo Veydimeng am yatey rako na nipasarayan jyaken, na nipaitan jyaken. So da ikamimin no akma tey kakteh do cinai a yasomaray nimo."
1239883,"Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, ","Am ori an, no ko manoyong a akma moy kakteh do cinai do ta kapacikaop ji Kizisto am ji ko amwan nimo a pahanhanen a mahap so ciring ko. "
1239884,"yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. ","Ko katenngan o katey rako no pangarilawan mo so tao.

1239885,"I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: ","O yako kakdain jimo am ikarilaw mo si Onaysemo an.

1239886,"which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: ",No kakwa pa am abo o ilamnayan na jimo. Am sicyaikwaya am yana ilamnain rana imo a ka nyaken.
1239887,"whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: ","Ko na peysinaolin jimo sicyaikwaya si Onaysemo a mangay jimo do dang, a ney kaglaw ko akmey minapodpod jyaken. "
1239888,"whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: ","Ko kakdain o kato na ngyanan do katangked ko akmey kataotao mo a mapeyveyveken jyaken, do aptengan da jyaken a meylimwang no Mapasaray a Ciriciring. "
1239889,"but without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. ","So ko kakdayan jimo a to meynakem nya ikarilaw. Taosya kasalit mo a marilaw nya. Am no si ji mo amya am cyaha, to ko macipanadngi imo."
1239890,"For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; ","Ala nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to o mina kakaro na jimo so alikey ni Onaysemo. Am cyaha, ta ji na rana ngaro imo a mangay no makwa. "
1239891,"not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? ",Iya rana sicyakwaya am beken a lamlamsoy an.

1239903,"who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; ",Yatomwaw jya o azwazway ni Ama ta do to.

1239905,"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, And he shall be to me a Son?","Abo asa ka tinsi a nipancyan na nya ni Ama ta do to so, ""Imo am Anak ko imo an.

1239906,"And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. ","Am tovoin na o veyvowen na Anak ni Ama ta do to do karawan am maniring si Ama ta do to am, ""Mamimin sira o tinsi a amraralay nya."""
1239907,"And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, And his ministers a flame of fire.",O mina ciring ni Ama ta do to a omagaz do tinsi am pahanhanen na sira akman so pagpag a kano apoy so kamamagenan.
1239908,"But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: A sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.","Am pagazen na ni Ama ta do to o ciring na do Anak na am, ""Oyowyat mo a Tao do to a tomalamozong no tao do karawan am todangay do kaidan no karawan.

1239909,"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; Therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed theeWith the oil of gladness above thy fellows.","O yapya vazay o mo ikakza.

1239910,"And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the works of thine hands:","Maniring pa am, ""Mo Panirsirngen, imo niomamaog so karawan. Nyamaog mo o hanit no lima mo."
1239911,They shall perish; but thou remainest: And they all shall wax old as doth a garment;,Amyan so kasaraw a ikabalinas da. Am imo am to ka meyyonong. So ikanoyong da akmey ayob a mararalaw.
1239912,"And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, And they shall be changed: But thou art the same, And thy years shall not fail.","Akman so ayob o karawan a topin a kapalit mo rana so vayo. Am imo am ka jyablis a abo so pangavosan."""
1239913,"But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool?","Ji na pa nipanci ni Ama ta do to do tinsi o, ""Amlisna ka do wanan ko, mangay no si balinasen ko sira o macioya jimo a tao."""

1239915,"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. ","Am ori an, peyyanan ta so nimamizing ta a nanao na ni Ama ta do to do onowned ta. Ta ori o ji ta macisyai do manoyong a nanao na ni Ama ta do to. "
1239916,"For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; ",O nipeylimwang no tinsi do ineynapo ta a iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to am yamanoyong rana. Ta sira rana yaji ngahap so nanao eya am yarana nimeydedna jira o peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239917,"how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; ",No yamanoyong o akman sang am no si to ta nazibwan si Ama ta do to a mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato am makongo ta tomayo no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to. Ta nipeylimwang na rana jyaten ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta o kavyay na jyaten ni Ama ta do to. So nipancyan da rana nya jyaten no nimakamizing sya tao. 
1239918,"God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?","Yakman sang, ta nioyatan na sira ni Ama ta do to a mapeyvazay so makakaday a yamapeyzokab a vazay a yongkad no kanoyong no ipangnanao da.

1239919,"For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. ",O yaomanam a yana amaogen a vayo a karawan ni Ama ta do to am beken a tinsi o nipamnekan na a tomalamozong nya. 
1239920,"But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?","Ta tao o nipamnekan na a tomalamozong nya, yakman so ciring a yadomket do Seysyo.

1239921,"Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; Thou crownedst him with glory and honour, And didst set him over the works of thy hands:","No kamaog mo sira am maveveveh pa sira kano tinsi. Am kanisomakop mo jira no azwazway mo, "
1239922,"Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him. ","a tomalamozong no makakaday do karawan.""

1239923,"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. ",Am o akman sang a vazay am nimangononong rana do mina katazak na tao ni Yeso a yamaveveveh pa kano tinsi. Am jya nimeyyonownay.

1239924,"For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. ",O alalaw na ni Yeso Kizisto am ori o na nipazanodan jyaten akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to a macikasaray do azwazway na.

1239925,"For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, ",Na nivonas o raraten no tao do karawan. So yada rana ipacingay ji Kizisto a mapeyyama si Ama ta do to no yarana nimavonas so raraten a tao. Am ori o na rana ji macimasneki nira ni Yeso a akma ney kakteh do cinai. 
1239926,"saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.","Maniring am, ""Mo Ama do to, ipeylimwang ko do akma koy kakteh o ngaran mo. Anooden ko imo do tangain no aro a tao."""
1239927,"And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.","Maniring pa am, ""Ipeyhanhan ko si Ama ta do to."" Maniring pa am, ""Cita pala yamen a yamalovot do jya kano yana nitoro jyaken a yaomanod jyaken a tao."""
1239928,"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; ",Yaten rana akma ney anak ni Ama ta do to am tao ta do karawan. So nicyakman na jyaten ni Yeso a yamyan so kataotao. Am mawakwak rana o kataotao na ni Yeso am haragen na o oyowyat ni Satan a omwakwak so tao. 
1239929,and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. ,O jyojika na ni Yeso Kizisto am isidong na so manyahey no kawakwak da do karawan a tao a kabo na rana no ikanyahey da do ikamavyay da pa. 
1239930,For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. ,Na ji nidonga o tinsi. Ta na sidongen yaten a sivosivovoong ni Apolahan. 
1239931,"Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. ","O peypeypangayan no kapeyngongyod na tao ni Yeso Kizisto am amyan rana so peyneynaran na sya do alalaw no tao do karawan a kapakateneng na rana do ahahapan na sya a marilaw nyaten a mapasyasi nyaten ji Ama ta do to, do ka iya na no ney manhama na mapatanatanang nyaten so nakem ta ji Ama ta do to. Am ori o ikanoyong ta na nivonas na rana ni Ama ta do to so raraten. "
1239932,"For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.","Ikongo do nimapeyneynara na rana o alalaw na kano littan na jya ni Satan, am ori o na ikanoyong a makasidong so littan ni Satan a tao."
1239933,"Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; ",Inyo rana akma koy kakteh do cinai a yana rana nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to a omanop jya am naknakmen nyo si Yeso a yana nitovoy ni Ama ta do to do teyrahem. Iya rana am ney manhama na mapatanatanang so nakem ta ji Ama ta do to a yata pangozayan a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to. 
1239934,"who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house. ","Si Yeso rana am na ji pasalai si Ama ta do to a yanimamnek jya, akman si Moyse a ji mapasala do vazay ni Ama ta do to a tomalamozong no amraralay ni Ama ta do to a tao. "
1239935,"For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. ",O tao rana mapatnek so vahay am arakorako pa o kazwayan na kano vahay na. Akman sang ta arakorako pa o kazwayan ni Yeso a kani Moyse. 
1239936,For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God. ,Yamamimin o vahay a yanyamaog no lima no tao. Am si Ama ta do to am nimangamaog so makakaday. 
1239937,"And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; ",Ji mapasalasala si Moyse a lamlamsoy ni Ama ta do to do vazay na. So ikanoyong na no ciring na ni Moyse a meylimwang no meypanam pa ciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1239938,"but Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. ",Akman sang si Yeso Kizisto a ji mapasala do vazay ni Ama ta do to a tomalamozong no amraralay ni Ama ta do to a tao. Am iya am Anak na ni Ama ta do to. No ji ta hayo a meyhanhan nya a omapanala so nakem na jyaten no makwa am manoyong ta macikaop ji Ama ta do to.
1239939,"Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice, ","Am ori o peycirngan na sya no Seyzi. Maniring am, ""No si mamizing nyo o ciring na jinyo ni Ama ta do to sicyaraw eya am, "
1239940,"Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, In the day of temptation in the wilderness:",taosya o keynara nyo so ineynapo nyo a to nazibo no ciring na ni Ama ta do to a mapasobna jya a niomileylamdam sya do kabwan no nihakawan no tao.
1239941,"When your fathers tempted me, proved me, And saw my works forty years.","Maniring si Ama ta do to am, Tana yarana makasikapat (40) so awawan o ineynapo nyo a yanimakacita so vazay ko am alalasan da pa yaken a askadan do yanan da."
1239942,"Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, And said, They do alway err in their heart; And they have not known my ways.","Am ori o nioyyan ko no tao no kanang. Maniring ko rana am, 'Da pasobnan yaken a ji ngamiznga so ciring.'"
1239943,"So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)","To ko na mancyan o kapeyoyaoya ko a kaji da makaransan do ipanci ko a pamahamahan da."""
1239944,"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. ",Inyo rana akma koy kakteh do cinai am meypepzat kamo an. Ta kalittan o onowned no tatasa jinyo a meyparai do to meyyonong a Tao do to ta a ji manganoyong. 
1239945,"But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. ",Mangday kamo do araraw a amvavaga do kadwan jinyo do yanyo ikavyay pa ya. Ta kalittan o tatasa jinyo a to nazibo ni Ama ta do to. 
1239946,"For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end; ",No ji ta haha so nakem ji Ama ta do to am manoyong ta macizanod ji Kizisto a mahap so vazay na. 
1239947,"while it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. ","Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""No si mamizing nyo o ciring na jinyo ni Ama ta do to sicyaraw eya am taosya o keynara nyo so ineynapo nyo a to nazibo nya a ji ngamizing si Ama ta do to."""
1239948,"For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. ",Sino sira o mapasobna a tao. O nyagag ni Moyse a tao saon apo do Ayci am. 
1239949,"But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? ","Sino sira o nioya ni Ama ta do to a makasikapat (40) so awawan. Sira saon o nimawakwak do kabwan no nihakawan no tao am, do kanimeyraraten da. "
1239950,"And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? ",Am sino sira o mina to na rana mamneki ni Ama ta do to a ji zagpit do pamahamahan da. O jya nimangamizing a tao saon am. 
1239951,So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.,"Tamo katenngan o kaji da nimakatokodan so pamahamahan da a angayan na jira ni Ama ta do to, do kaji da manganoyngan."
1239952,"Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. ",Am ori o naknakman nyo so kato nyo ngotokotan so nakem a omanoyong ji Ama ta do to. Ta no si ji kamo manganoyong am ji kamo macikaop ji Ama ta do to. 
1239953,"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. ",Tamo akman so ineynapo ta ang a yarana nimakamizing so Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Am da ji meypapyan o da nimamizing a nanao na ni Ama ta do to. Ta da ji nganoyngi. 
1239954,"For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. ","Yaten rana yamanganoyong a tao am manoyong o kapacikaop ta na ji Ama ta do to. Ta maniring si Ama ta do to am, ""To ko na mancyan o kapeyoyaoya ko a kaji da makaransan do ipanci ko a pamahamahan da."" Tana nimeycicinda no kakwa o keyyan no pamahamahan da no kakavos no karawan a nyamaog na ni Ama ta do to am ji da tokod o pamahamahan ang, ta ji da nganoyngi. "
1239955,"For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. ","Amyan do Seysyo so asa ka vakong a yanan no makalavat so ikapito na araw. O domket dang am, ""Nimeyvazay si Ama ta do to do kanem a araw a kapamahamaha na do ikapito na araw."""
1239956,"And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.","Maniring pa am, ""To sira angay do kaidan no karawan o ji ko payaknengi sira."""
1239957,"Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: ",Sira rana nimanmanma makamizing so Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am ji da nimatokod o pamahamahan da. Ta ji da nyamizing si Ama ta do to. Am o tao rana a omanoyong ji Ama ta do to am macikaop sira ji Ama ta do to. 
1239958,"again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, Harden not your hearts.","Na rana vahangsowen do jya o na kapamnek ni Ama ta do to so kasaraw a yaipanci a ""sicyaraw eya."" Mownay am toywen na ni Tawey o ciring ni Ama ta do to. So na idket rana do Seysyo. Maniring am, ""No si mamizing nyo sicyaraw eya o ciring na ni Ama ta do to am ji nyo a oyyan."""
1239959,"For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. ",No si manoyong si Jyesoya a nimangay no aro a tao a mamahamaha do nipanci ni Ama ta do to a pamahamahan da am jyabo o kapakalavat na pa so kasaraw a ipakahap ta so nakem na jyaten ni Ama ta do to a. 
1239960,There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. ,So na ikanoyong ni Ama ta do to a yanimangata so kasaraw a yana itaziman do yamonganay jya tao. 
1239961,"For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. ","Ta o tao rana a macikaop ji Ama ta do to am mahap da rana o keylamnayan da kano ikapiya no onowned da, do kapeyhanhan da ni Ama ta do to a macikaop rana jira. "
1239962,"Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. ",Am ori o ikowyowyat ta pa a omonot do ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Ta ori o ipacikaop ta ji Ama ta do to. Sino ka paro a ominara so ji nganoyong do ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a tao a yatey marahet so vazay.
1239963,"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. ",O Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am tey rako o oyowyat na. So ikowyowyat na pa kano matarem a takzes a to makatjip so asisi a kano totowang. So ikakman na sang so kowyowyat no Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a makateneng do onowned a nakenakem no tao. 
1239964,Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.,Abo o makatayo do tangain ni Ama ta do to. O yamakakaday do karawan a nyamaog na am yabo na jyacita so vazay. So ikamimin ta katenngan na so onowned do tangain ni Ama ta do to.
1239965,"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. ",Am ori o pangozayan ta do nakem ta yamraralay ni Ama ta do to. Ta yata ipeyhanhan si Yeso a ney manhama na mapatanatanang nyaten so nakem ta ji Ama ta do to. Iya rana am Anak ni Ama ta do to a yarana myan do tangain ni Ama ta do to. 
1239966,"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. ",Si Yeso Kizisto am panoyngen na yaten a tao do karawan a ji makanet so nakenakem. Ta iya rana am nimasapa na o makakaday a ilita na jya ni Satan. Am jya nikalittan. Iya am abo o raraten na. 
1239967,"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.","Am ori an, ji tamo a mogawi a omasngen do tangain ni Ama ta do to a omahap so itoro na jyaten a pangangasyan na kano pangangarilawan na a isidong ta so kataotao ta no makasazi ta so alalaw ta."
1239968,"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: ","O nipamnekan da no tao do Yotay a panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am mapasyasi nira ji Ama ta do to, a mapatanang nira so makakaday a sarayan da ni Ama ta do to, kapatanang na so rala no kagling a kano baka a ivonas na so raraten da. "
1239969,"who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. ","Amyan so karatan na no mapatanatanang so nakem da tao, ta meyyangay sira tao. Am ori o kanigan na no amyan so kalasan a tao a mapasyasi nira ji Ama ta do to. "
1239970,"And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. ",Ori o pazanodan na so kataotao na ipasyasi ji Ama ta do to a ivonas na so raraten da. 
1239971,"And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. ","Abo o tao a mapasolib so kataotao na do panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to. Ta o nitenngan ni Ama ta do to o mangay do dang, akman so tao a meyngaran so Yalon. "
1239972,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, To day have I begotten thee.","Yakman sang si Kizisto a yaji nimamnek do kataotao na a panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem ta si Ama ta do to, ta nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to a nimamnek jya. Ta maniring si Ama ta do to jya am, ""Imo am Anak ko imo an. So peylimwangan ko nimo a mapeyyama jyaken sicyaraw eya."""
1239973,"As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for everAfter the order of Melchisedec.","Maniring pa am, ""Imo rana am akman ka si Mocisete a mapatanatanang so nakem no tao a mapasyasi nira jyaken a mangay do kaidan no karawan."""
1239974,"Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; ","No keyyan na pa ni Yeso do karawan am nimlolos a mapasyasi ji Ama ta do to a mapatastas sya do kawakwakan na. So niiteng no kaoo na mapasyasi ji Ama ta do to. Ikongo do nipehbo na o kataotao na, am ori o nyamizngan na sya ni Ama ta do to so ciring na. "
1239975,"though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; ",Tana Anak na ni Ama ta do to am nimasazi na o alalaw a ipeypahagnat na so nakem na a omonot ji Ama ta do to. 
1239976,"and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; ","Komavos o vazay na ni Yeso am tombod rana jya o to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da no yaomonot jya tao, "
1239977,called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.,"a kapamnek na ji Yeso ni Ama ta do to a ney manhama na a mapatanatanang nyaten so nakem ta ji Ama ta do to a mangay do kaidan no karawan, akman si Mocisete."
1239978,"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing. ",O akman rana sang a vazay am yaro pa dang o ciring ko a yamakekdeng am nyo kaji makazazaban a tao. 
1239979,"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. ",No kamo mowyat a yamacinanao am kamo na mangnanao. Am asyosyo kamo eya a yada pananawen no tao no yatodalapit a ciring na ni Ama ta do to. So nyo icyakmey metdeh a yapa somoso. 
1239980,For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. ,O somoso a tao am ji pa makaveyvow. So ji na makatenngi do apya kano marahet. 
1239981,"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.","O asa ka ciring dang am o makaveyvow o koman so cinvevekeh, ta mapeyneynara da rana. Akman so sang o makaveyvow a tao a makateneng do apya kano marahet."
1239982,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, ","Yaten rana am meypahagnat tamo rana so nakem ji Ama ta do to. Taosya o kato ta oliolyan sya amizngen so ta na katenngan a nanao ni Ama ta do to do kapamlis a manganoyong, "
1239983,"of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. ",a kano nanao na jyaten do manaktak a kano panlanlagan da nyaten no tao a mapaopta so lima da jyaten a kano nanao a omaing do mirwa mavyay a kano nanao na omaing do peykapyapinpinan na so tao ni Ama ta do to. Ta o akman rana sang am yatey masangib rana ori a yata mamizing. 
1239984,"And this will we do, if God permit. ","Am ori an, ipeypahagnat tamo a macinanao do makdeng a nanao ni Ama ta do to. Ta ori o isaray na ni Ama ta do to."
1239985,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, ","Ta o yamlikod do nanao ni Ama ta do to a tao am makongo sira ori a mamlis, do katenngan da rana si Ama ta do to, a nimakahap rana so karilawan na nira ni Ama ta do to, a yanan rana no Seyzi. "
1239986,"and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, ",Sira rana am mapeyneynara da rana o katey yapya na no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. So da ipakateneng do mapeyzokab a oyowyat ni Ama ta do to. 
1239987,"if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. ",Sira rana ya a to ngaro do manoyong a nanao ni Ama ta do to am abo rana o tao a makapeysinaoli so nakenakem da. Ta sira rana am akmey to da oliya o Anak ni Ama ta do to a padketen do jyojika a peyleylaken do tangain no tao.
1239988,"For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: ",No masangib a kacimoyan o nihakawan am isaod na. O akman rana sang am tey yapya do mata no mapeynihakawan sya. Am ori rana am si Ama ta do to o mapasaod sya. 
1239989,"but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.",Am no maday a tamek omlida do nihakawan am to rana wagwaga o akman sang. O akman sang a tao am balinasen na ni Ama ta do to.
1239990,"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. ",Am inyo rana manga keypong am tana akman sang o ciring ko am yako anoyngan o kapyapya na pa no mahap nyo a patazadangen na ni Ama ta do to do teyngato. 
1239991,"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. ",Ji mapeycyakaban si Ama ta do to. So na ji makahamangi do pangangarilawan nyo a kano vazay nyo. Ori rana am vazay nyo do karwan no sinjya a yajimtad a yasomidong sira. 
1239992,And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: ,O ney makdeng na yako kakzeben jinyo am mamimin kamo a jyablis so kakdekdeng so nakem a mangay no makwa. Ta ori o ipangononong no makakaday a kakdain nyo no nakem a itoro na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. 
1239993,"that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.",Namen ji mamyapyan inyo a malma so onowned. Inarahen nyo sira o yaji macizizikna a yaomanoyong ji Ama ta do to a tao. Ta ori o ipakahap nyo so makakaday a nakem na jinyo ni Ama ta do to.
1239994,"For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, ","Nipanci na ni Ama ta do to ji Apolahan o keyyan no nakem na jya. Am to na mangozai o ngaran na a manci no keyyan no nakem na ji Apolahan, do kabo no makahad si Ama ta do to do karawan. "
1239995,"saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. ","Maniring am, ""Pangononongan ko o aryarilaw ko jimo a mapasaod so sivosivovoong mo."""
1239996,"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. ",Ji na macimangsahi ni Apolahan a pananalahen. Makarahan am mahap na rana o nakem na sya ni Ama ta do to.
1239997,For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. ,O tao rana do karawan am no amyan so makdeng a ciring da am manara sira so meynakem a tao a omamizing so ciring da a omagaz do ikazyak da a izavat da so masalit a vazay. 
1239998,"Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: ","Mina to na rana mancyan ni Ama ta do to o kaji na ablisan no nakenakem na sira so tao a omamoon so mina ciring na jira. Am ori o nyaitan na do ciring na ni Ama ta do to akma ney yongkad. O nipasongsong na ciring am ngaran na ni Ama ta do to, "
1239999,"that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: ",a ipadnadna na so nakem ta a yameyhanhan nya. Ta iya rana am jyabliblis o ahahapan na sya. 
1240000,"which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; ","Yamyan rana jyaten so yata ipeyhanhan. So icyakma ney nitkehnan a lalitan no pahad ta, yarana jyagonagonay a meypangay nyaten do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. "
1240001,"whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.","Si Yeso am yarana nimanmanma a nimangay do tangain ni Ama ta do to a mapasyasi nyaten. So ikanoyong na ney manhama na mapatanatanang nyaten so nakem ta ji Ama ta do to a mangay do kaidan no karawan, akman si Mocisete."
1240002,"For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; ",O meyngaran so Mocisete am panirsirngen da no Saleng. Iya ori am panirsirngen da no mapatanatanang nira so nakem da ji Ama ta do to. Teyka na sira balinasen ni Apolahan o apat a ka panirsirngen am meysinaoli rana. Meyratateng am rapongen na no meyngaran so Mocisete a kapanlanlag na nya. 
1240003,"to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; ","O ineynahap ni Apolahan a apzapzatan no kapeyyarap da am pasinahen na o asa vovonongan a itoro ji Mocisete. O peypeypangayan no ngaran ni Mocisete am ""Ji mapeycyakaban so tao a panirsirngen"". Ikongo do panirsirngen da no Saleng, am ori o pancyan da no ngaran na a ""Ikapiya no onowned no tao a panirsirngen"". "
1240004,"without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.",Si Mocisete rana am abo do vakong o domket a ngaran no ama na kano ina na. So icyakman da sang no iteytetngehan da. So ji da nimapadkeci so araraw no cinatazak na kano cinawakwak na. So icyakma dey meyyangay a kano Anak ni Ama ta do to a mapatanatanang so nakem a mangay do kaidan no karawan.
1240005,"Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. ",Naknakmen nyo pala. Jyabo na kajyahamahaman pa ni Mocisete do kanimapasina na no ineynapo ta si Apolahan so ineynahap na so asa vovonongan ji Mocisete. 
1240006,"And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: ",O apwapo da ni Diwey a mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am tana meyyangangay sira kano Isedi a tao a sivosivovoong ni Apolahan am to da mangozai o iwawalam a komakaday so Isedi a tao pangapan so asa vovonongan a kanen da a illam da sira. 
1240007,"but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. ",Am tana ji macitetngehan si Mocisete ji Diwey am macivonong do ineynahap ni Apolahan so asa vovonongan a kapanlanlag na ni Mocisete si Apolahan a omamoon so mina ciring na jya ni Ama ta do to. 
1240008,And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. ,O manlanlag no tao am makarakarang pa sira ori a kano ipanlanlag da tao. So ji na alasi no akman sang a ciring. 
1240009,"And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. ","O mapatanatanang so nakem da si Ama ta do to am mangap sira do tao so asa vovonongan a illam da sira. Am mawakwak pa sira ang. Am si Mocisete am tana nimangap so asa vovonongan am akmey todavyay, do kaji da nimvatvatkan do Seysyo so araraw no cinatazak na kano cinawakwak na. "
1240010,"And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. ","Am ori an, mapasina si Apolahan so asa vovonongan am akmey to macizanod si Diwey a manta ni Mocisete so asa vovonongan. "
1240011,"For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.",Am no kangay na amrapong si Apolahan ni Mocisete am ji pa nimalikey si Diwey. Am macitetngehan ji Apolahan.
1240012,"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law, ) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? ","O iwawalam no Isedi a tao am nimakalapo no kakwa o kapangozay da do iwawalam ni Diwey a mapatanang so nakem da ji Ama ta do to. No makanet rana ori a ipakasalap ta do teyngato am ikongo tovoyan na pa ni Ama ta do to si Yeso Kizisto a mapatanatanang nyaten so nakem ta ji Ama ta do to akman si Mocisete, a iblis na so adan a iwawalam ni Yalon."
1240013,"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. ",Tovoin na ni Ama ta do to si Kizisto am mablis rana o iwawalam no mapatanatanang so nakem no kakwa. 
1240014,"For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. ",Ta si Yeso a Panirsirngen ta am yaji monganay do iteytetngehan ni Diwey. Ta macitetngehan da Yoda. Sira rana am abo pa jira o nimangay do mapatanang so nakem no tao ji Ama ta do to. Ta no kapakalavat ni Moyse so mapatanatanang so nakem si Ama ta do to am ji na nimalavat o itetngehan da Yoda.Ta si Yeso a Panirsirngen ta am yaji monganay do iteytetngehan ni Diwey. Ta macitetngehan da Yoda. Sira rana am abo pa jira o nimangay do mapatanang so nakem no tao ji Ama ta do to. Ta no kapakalavat ni Moyse so mapatanatanang so nakem si Ama ta do to am ji na nimalavat o itetngehan da Yoda.
1240015,"And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. ",Yarana mapengkad sicyaikwaya o na kaniomablis rana ni Ama ta do to so iwawalam ni Moyse. Ta si Yeso rana o yavayo a mapatanatanang nyaten so nakem ta ji Ama ta do to yakman si Mocisete. Ta beken a na pangozayan o iwawalam no tao. Ta na pangozayan o na kato meyyonongan a mavyay a Tao do to. Yarana mapengkad sicyaikwaya o na kaniomablis rana ni Ama ta do to so iwawalam ni Moyse. Ta si Yeso rana o yavayo a mapatanatanang nyaten so nakem ta ji Ama ta do to yakman si Mocisete. Ta beken a na pangozayan o iwawalam no tao. Ta na pangozayan o na kato meyyonongan a mavyay a Tao do to. 
1240016,"For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for everAfter the order of Melchisedec.","Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Imo rana am mapatanatanang ka so nakem no tao a mapasyasi nira jyaken a mangay do kaidan no karawan, akman si Mocisete."""
1240017,For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. ,"So na rana ikablis no adan a iwawalam ni Moyse, ta yabo oyowyat na mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato. "
1240018,"For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. ","Am cyaha, ta yarana myan so yapyapya pa hanhan ta a mapanop jyaten ji Ama ta do do. Iya rana am si Yeso Kizisto."
1240019,And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: ,Amyan so apyapya pa nyahahapan na sya ni Ama ta do to. Ta no kapamnek na ji Yeso a mapatanatanang so nakem am amyan so makdeng a ciring na. Ta no kapamnek da no tao do sivosivovoong ni Diwey a mapatanatanang so nakem am abo o makdeng a ciring na jira ni Ama ta do to. 
1240020,"(for those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for everAfter the order of Melchisedec:)","Am si Yeso am amyan so ciring na sya ni Ama ta do to. Maniring am, ""Ji ko na ablisi o nakenakem ko a mamnek jimo a mapatanatanang so nakem no tao a mapasyasi nira jyaken a mangay do kaidan no karawan."""
1240021,By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. ,So ikanoyong na ni Yeso Kizisto a yongkad ni Ama ta do to a mangononong do vayo a pangozayan a ciring na jyaten. So ikapyapya na pa no vayo a pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to a kano adan a ciring na a nitaid na ji Moyse.
1240022,"And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: ",O asa pa ko ipanci am o nipanlanlag da mapatanatanang so nakem no tao no kakwa am aro sira mapalipalit. Ta no mawakwak sira am todakteb rana o vazay da. 
1240023,"but this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. ",Am si Yeso rana am yato meyyonong a yamavyay. So yana ikabo no tao a makamoon so vazay na. 
1240024,"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.","Am ori o yana ikanoyong a yamakasidong so yaomanop ji Ama ta do to a tao, do yana kato meyyonongan a mavyay a yamapasyasi nyaten ji Ama ta do to."
1240025,"For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; ",So yana ikanoyong ni Yeso a ney manokdwan na a ta ipeyhanhan a mapatanatanang nyaten so nakem ta ji Ama ta do to. Ta yabo na karatan a yabo so raraten. Iya rana am na nipapinpin ni Ama ta do to do yameyraraten a tao. So ikanoyong na rana ney mazway na do teyrahem a kado teyngato. 
1240026,"who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. ","Iya am yamacitarek a kano aro a panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem, do yana kaji mangdayan so araraw a yamapatanang so nakem da a ivonas so raraten da no tao. Iya rana am ipisa mapatanang so nakem na kato na rana ngavosan. O na nipatanang am kataotao na. "
1240027,"For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.",O nipamnekan no iwawalam ni Moyse a mapatanatanang so nakem am tao sira. So iyan no karatan da. Am o nipamnekan ni Ama ta do to a mapatanatanang so nakem am Anak na. So ikabo no karatan na. So to na meyyonongi a makasidong so tao no vazay na mangay do kaidan no karawan.
1240028,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; ",O yamakdeng a yata malavat am yamyan so ney manhama na mapatanatanang nyaten so nakem ta si Ama ta do to. Iya rana am si Yeso a yamhezsad do wanan na ni Ama ta do to do teyngato. 
1240029,"a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. ","Iya rana am yamyan do yamanoyong a raralayan ni Ama ta do to do teyngato a mapasyasi nyaten ji Ama ta do to. Am o yana yanan am beken a nyamaog no tao, ta nyamaog ni Ama ta do to. "
1240030,For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. ,"O vazay da no panipanirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem ji Ama ta do to no kakwa am patanangen da o nakem da a sarayan da ni Ama ta do to, a kapatanang da so rala no kagling a kano baka a ivonas da so raraten da. So icyakman na sang ni Yeso a mapatanang ji Ama ta do to. "
1240031,"For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: ","No yamyan pa si Yeso do teyrahem am ji na peyvazaya o kapatanatanang na so nakem no tao ji Ama ta do to, ta amyan rana so mapeyvazay sya a mangozay do iwawalam no tao do Yotay. "
1240032,"who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. ","O vazay na no mapatanatanang so nakem no tao ji Ama ta do to do teyrahem am akmey avwavong no meyngongyod a vazay do teyngato. Ta ninara da o vazay do panaralayan do teyngato. O ipakateneng ta do akman sang am yamyan do Seysyo o nipanci na ni Ama ta do to ji Moyse no kapangamaog na so raralayan da ni Ama ta do to. Maniring jya si Ama ta do to am, ""Naknakmen mo an. Ta to mo peynara o panaralayan a nipacita ko jimo do tokon so kamamaogan a paringen."""
1240033,"But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. ",Am o vazay na ni Yeso a mapatanatanang so nakem ta ji Ama ta do to am maharahara pa kano vazay da no mapatanatanang so nakem no tao do teyrahem. Ta si Yeso rana am nipanop na yaten no vayo a pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to. O vayo a pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to am omaing do mina ciring na ni Ama ta do to so omanoyong jya tao. So ikapyapya na pa no nang a kano adan a pangozayan a ciring.
1240034,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. ",No abo karatan no manmanma a pangozayan a ciring am tana abo o ikadwa no pangozayan a ciring am makanet rana. 
1240035,"For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, When I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:","Am ioya na ni Ama ta do to o Isedi a tao. Maniring am, ""Yarana makeykai o araraw no patnekan ko no Isedi a tao a kano Yoda tao so vayo a pangozayan a ciring."
1240036,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathersIn the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; Because they continued not in my covenant, And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.","O vayo a pangozayan da ciring am ji meyyangay a kano adan a nipangozayan da a ciring no ineynapo da no kakwa. Ta no kanang am nikalay ko o lima da a nyagag do Ayci. Am da ji mangononongi o nitoro ko jira a pangozayan da a ciring. Am ori o nipancyan ko no, 'Ji ko na peyvazaya sira.'"
1240037,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of IsraelAfter those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And write them in their hearts: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people:","Maniring pa jira si Ama ta do to am, 'Ipatnek ko sira o Isedi a tao so pangozayan da a ciring no makwa. Peydednahen ko o iwawalam ko do oo da kapangay ko sya do onowned da. Abneken da yaken a Tao do to da. Abneken ko sira akma koy anak."
1240038,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest.",Abo jira o manci nya do icyatatao da kano akma dey kakteh do cinai so kapanaralay da makateneng jyaken. Ta sira rana am tana kanakan a tana rarakeh am yatodamimin sira yamakateneng jyaken.
1240039,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.","Vonasen ko o raraten da. Ji ko na naknakma o karatan da.'"""
1240040,"In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.","Yarana nimangamaog si Ama ta do to so vayo a pangozayan a ciring a nyalit na do adan a pangozayan a ciring. So to na rana tastasi no adan a pangozayan a ciring, ta abo rana o oyowyat na."
1240041,"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary. ",O manmanma a pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to am domket dang o katwatontonan no raralayan da ni Ama ta do to a kano nipatnek da no tao a vahay a raralayan da nya. 
1240042,"For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. ","So nitnek na rana no akmey sarwap a ananaten da vahay a panaralayan. O manma aspangan do sahad na am ipanci da Meynakem a vahay, yanan no peyzeyzampwan a kano akakanan a kano nipatanang da ji Ama ta do to a pang. "
1240043,"And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; ",O peyyawwan no manma aspangan a kano katangked na vahay am milakayob o nipeyhawa da sya. O peyyawwan da sya no milakayob am Ney manokdwan na vahay. 
1240044,"which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; ",Amyan dang so asleban da so mahangno a haneng. O panlenleban am ovay o akma ney kolit. O amyan pa dang am meykavahayan so ovay a kavangan. O makonokon do dang am tagaw a ovay a yanan no mana kano nitomyok a sisikod ni Yalon a kano vato a adketan no nanao na ni Ama ta do to a nitaid na ji Moyse. 
1240045,and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly. ,O teyngato no kavangan am amyan dang so akmey tinsi a nyamaog no ovay a ngaranan da keloping. O peypeypangayan no nang am peydednan ni Ama ta do to. O panid no keloping ori am mavezay a ombonbon do pangapangayan da so rala no kagling a kano baka a ivonas so raraten no tao. O makakaday rana vazay am ji to mimin a ipanci sicyaikwaya.
1240046,"Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. ",O katwatontonan no makakaday a vazay am mangday sira so araw o mapatanatanang so nakem a mangay do sahad no manma aspangan na vahay a mapatanang so nakem da ji Ama ta do to. 
1240047,"But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: ",Am o Panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem am no somdep do katangked na vahay am abo ikararwa na. Ipisa do kasa kawan a somdep. No somdep am mangap so rala no kagling a kano baka a patanangen na a ivonas na so monganay jya raraten na kano ji da ningongyod a raraten da no macikeylyan a tao. 
1240048,"the Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: ",O katwatontonan no raralayan ni Ama ta do to am Seyzi o mapananao nya. Ta no jyabalinas o akman so sang a adan a raralayan ni Ama ta do to am masalit o kato ngonongonongan jya no tao so kangay do tangain ni Ama ta do to. 
1240049,"which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; ",O peypeypangayan no yanimalavat ta makakaday a vazay ori am ipakateneng ta do kaji na makanetan no patanangen da kagling a kano baka ji Ama ta do to a ivonas so raraten no tao. 
1240050,"which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.",Ta do ji na pa nimapatwawi ni Ama ta do to so apyapya pa kano adan a pangozayan a ciring am mamimin pa ori a omagaz do icicirawat a kano isovo a kanen.
1240051,"But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; ",Am yarana nimakaranes si Kizisto a ney manhama na yamapanop jyaten ji Ama ta do to a yamai no vayo a pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to. So na ikapyapya pa kano adan a pangozayan a ciring. So yana rana iyan do teyngato ni Yeso. Ta apyapya ori a kano nyamaog no tao do teyrahem a panaralayan. 
1240052,"neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. ",Si Yeso Kizisto am ji rana mapalolo so rala no kagling a kano baka. Ta mina to na rana patananga o rala na ipatazadang na jyaten do teyngato. Am o akman rana sang a vazay am ipisa mapatanang nyaten a kakavos na rana a mangay do kaidan no karawan. 
1240053,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: ",No si saboin o tao no nikataheman no nitemtem a avo no baka ranom a kapasaboy da jira so rala no kagling a kano baka do ipanci da akmey makanyaw do iwawalam da am todavoga rana sira. 
1240054,"how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?",Kakwakwan na rana no rala no kagling a kano baka a ipanci da makavoga so nikaratan da. Imanngo rana o oyowyat no rala ni Kizisto. Ta nioyatan no Seyzi a mapatanang so abo so karatan a kataotao na ji Ama ta do to. Jyabo kaji na haraharan pa makavonas so marahet do onowned ta a ombalinas so malas a icicirawat ta. No si manoyong o kakman ta sang am manoyong ta pahanhanen na ni Ama ta do to do vazay na.
1240055,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. ",So ikanoyong ni Kizisto a yatomalamozong no vayo a pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to a somidong so nipamnekan na tao a omahap so nakem na jira. So na ikanoyong ni Kizisto a niomagag sira do raraten da a ji ngonot do manmanma pangozayan a ciring a nitaid na ji Moyse ni Ama ta do to.
1240056,"For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. ",O nitaid no toda jyawakwak a tao a ciring na am pangozayan da ori a ciring na no mawakwak rana. 
1240057,For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. ,Ta no mavyay pa tao a kataid na so ciring na am abo peypeypangayan no ciring na. Ta no si mawakwak rana o tomaid so ciring na am pangozayan da na o ciring a nitaid na jira. 
1240058,Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. ,Akman sang o ney manma na pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to no kakwa. Ta no abo o rala amvoyog a patanangen ji Ama ta do to am abo oyowyat no adan a pangozayan a ciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240059,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, ","O ney manma na am ipeylimwang ni Moyse o iwawalam ni Ama ta do to do aro a tao a kapangap na rana so rala no baka kano kagling pazavozen do ranom, kapangap na rana so akmey vangkoro a milakayob a pinabedbed do akmey kamanakaoy a kasaboy na so aro a tao a kano vakong a adketan no nanao ni Ama ta do to. "
1240060,"saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. ","Maniring am, ""O rala rana ya am yongkad na ni Ama ta do to a manci ninyo a omahap so pangozayan a ciring na."""
1240061,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. ",Akman sang si Moyse a mapasaboy so rala do akmey sarwap a panaralayan da kano makakaday amyan do sahad na a ipanaralay da. 
1240062,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.,To da mangozai o iwawalam da somaboy no rala so makakaday a ipanaralay da. No abo rala am jyavonas o raraten.
1240063,It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. ,Kakwakwan no panaralayan do teyrahem a yaominara sya do teyngato a yamangap so rala no kagling a kano baka a ipanvoga so tao. Ney manngo rana o panaralayan do teyngato. Jyabo kaji nakdekdengan pa no rala ni Yeso Kizisto do teyngato a ipanvoga na so tao ni Ama ta do to a. 
1240064,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: ",Jya nisomdep si Yeso do nyamaog no tao a akmey sarwap a panaralayan. Ta o nyamaog no tao am ji meyngongyod ori. Si Kizisto rana am yarana myan do teyngato a mapasyasi nyaten do tangain ni Ama ta do to. 
1240065,"nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; ",O panirsirngen no mapatanatanang so nakem no tao do Yotay am mangday so awawan o kapatanang da so rala no kagling a kano baka do Ney manokdwan na vahay. Am si Kizisto rana am ipisa mapatanang so kataotao na a ivonas na so raraten no tao. 
1240066,for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. ,O na icyakman sang ni Yeso a yarana ji vangovangon so iwawalam no tao do Yotay a mapatanang so rala am na rana nipatanang o kataotao na abo so raraten a ivoga na so raraten no tao. So na ikeypisa ni Yeso a mangay mawakwak nyaten a kato na rana meyyonongan a mavonas rana no raraten ta. 
1240067,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: ",Mamimin o tao a ipisa mawakwak. Am no mawakwak o tao am pacicin na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240068,so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.,Yakman sang si Kizisto a ipisa mapatanang so kataotao na a ivonas na so raraten no aro a tao. So ikeypisa na pa mai do teyrahem. Am beken a raraten o vazay na. Ta mangay na hapen sira o mapanala sya tao.
1240069,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. ",O iwawalam na ni Moyse am ji makanet pa ori. Ta ori rana am akma ney avwavong pa ori no pangangasyan na ni Yeso a itoro na jyaten. Akman sang o da patanangen a yajyates do awawan a kagling a kano baka. Ta makongo ori a mapeypapya so tao a mangay do tangain ni Ama ta do to. Jyabo o kapakasidong na so tao a. 
1240070,For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. ,No manoyong o kato na rana vonasan no raraten da no rala no kagling a kano baka am manoyong o kaji da rana makanakman so raraten da. So to na rana zavaci no kapatanatanang so kagling a kano baka. 
1240071,But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. ,Am o yapatanangan so kagling a kano baka ji Ama ta do to am ipakanakem da no tao so raraten da do awawan. 
1240072,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. ,Ta o rala no baka kano kagling am ji na vonas o raraten no tao.
1240073,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, But a body hast thou prepared me:","Am ori an, pancyan na nya ni Kizisto ji Ama ta do to no kai na do teyrahem, ""Mo jyakzan o yapatanangen a kagling a kano makakaday a nakem a patanangen jimo. Ta yamo rana nipanta yaken so kataotao a mahap so vazay mo."
1240074,In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.,Mo jyakzan o yatemtemen a kagling a kano baka. So mo ikakman so sang a yajyakza no rala no kagling a kano baka a ivonas so raraten no tao.
1240075,"Then said I, Lo, I come(In the volume of the book it is written of me, )To do thy will, O God.","Am ori o ko pancyan no, 'Oya ko do jya a yamangozay do nakenakem mo, mo Ama do to, akman so yadomket do Seysyo a yaomagaz jyaken a vazay.'"""
1240076,"Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; ","O ney manma na nipanci ni Kizisto jya am, ""Mo jyakzan o yapatanangen a kagling a kano makakaday, pacyangayan no rala a patanangen jimo a yamo ivonas so raraten."" Tana yada pangozayan o iwawalam a yamapatanang so makakaday am yakman sang o ciring na ni Kizisto. "
1240077,"then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. ","Maniring pa am, ""Mo Ama do to, oya ko do jya a yamangozay do nakenakem mo."" Am ori o mina to na rana nastasi ni Ama ta do to so adan a iwawalam ni Moyse. Ta na rana nyalitan ni Yeso Kizisto no kataotao na o adan a iwawalam ni Moyse. "
1240078,By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. ,Na nipangononongan ni Yeso o nakenakem ni Ama ta do to a yamahap so vazay na a yamapasansan so kataotao na do jyojika. Am yaipisaha na kato miminan so raraten ta yanivonas.
1240079,"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: ",O yamapatanatanang nira so nakem da no tao do Yotay am mangday so araw sira a yameytatanek a yamahap so vazay ni Ama ta do to a mapatanang so kagling a kano baka. Am yameyyangangay do araw o da patanangen. Tana todangay no makwa am ji na vonas o raraten no tao no rala no kagling a kano baka. 
1240080,"but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; ",Am o nipatanang na ni Kizisto a kataotao na am ipisaha. Am tey rako oyowyat na amvonas so raraten ta mangay do kaidan no karawan. So yana ilisna do wanan ni Ama ta do to. 
1240081,from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. ,Sicyaikwa rana ya am na rana panalahen si Ama ta do to a yamharag so yamacioya jya tao. 
1240082,For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. ,Ipisa si Yeso a nimvoyog so rala a kavonas na rana no raraten da no omanoyong jya tao a mangay do kaidan no karawan.
1240083,"Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, ","O ciring na jyaten no Seyzi do Seysyo am, "
1240084,"This is the covenant that I will make with themAfter those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, And in their minds will I write them;","""Maniring si Ama ta do to am, Ipatnek ko sira so vayo a pangozayan a ciring no makwa. Peydednahen ko o iwawalam ko do oo da a kapangay ko sya do onowned da."""
1240085,And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.,"Maniring pa am, ""Ji ko na peyyana do onowned ko o raraten da kano karatan da."""
1240086,"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.",Am no mavonas rana o raraten am todabo rana o patanangen da makakaday a ivonas da so raraten da.
1240087,"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, ","Manga kakteh, o peypeypangayan no cinawakwak na ni Yeso am ipakateneng ta do kaji ta rana vokahawan a mangay do tangain ni Ama ta do to. "
1240088,"by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; ",Na nipeywadwad yaten ni Yeso so vayo a rarahan ta. Ori rana am rarahan ori a mangay do tangain ni Ama ta do to. 
1240089,and having an high priest over the house of God; ,Yamyan so yata ipeyhanhan a ney manhama na mapatanatanang so nakem a mapasyasi nyaten ji Ama ta do to. Iya rana am si Yeso a yatomalamozong nyaten a macikaop jya. 
1240090,"let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. ",Am ori o ikanoyong ta jyablis so onowned a akmey nioyasan so onowned a kano kataotao a omanop ji Ama ta do to. 
1240091,Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) ,Am ori o ji ta na ablisi so nakem a to ngotokot no kararalay ta ni Ama ta do to. Ta o mina ciring na jyaten ni Ama ta do to am abo kalasan na. 
1240092,and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: ,Manakem ta o kapait ta so nakenakem do kadwan jyaten. Manakem ta o kasidong ta so kadwan jyaten a mapatwaw so pangangarilawan na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240093,"not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.","Ji ta nginara sira o yatatasa ka tao a yato nazibo no da kararalay ni Ama ta do to do kalwalovotan no tao. So ipasipapait ta, ta tamo na katenngan o na kasngen rana no araraw na no na yai ni Yeso. So ikakdekdeng tamo pa a mapait so kadwan jyaten."
1240094,"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, ",No katenngan ta na o nanao ni Ama ta do to a kapeyngongyod ta meyparai ji Ama ta do to a ji rana meysinaoli so onowned am abo rana o patanangen ta makavonas so akman sang a raraten. 
1240095,"but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. ",Sira rana to nazibo ni Ama ta do to a tao am kapananala da rana so peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to do makotokotod a lila no apoy a ombalinas sira. 
1240096,He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: ,"O mapasobna do iwawalam ni Moyse a tao am no si myan so rarwa a tatlo o nimakacita sira meyraraten am ji rana asyan sira, ta to rana wakwaka sira. "
1240097,"of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? ","O to ngolala so Anak na ni Ama ta do to a kano rala na a makavonas so raraten na, kato na nazibo no yamanta no tao so pangangasyan a Seyzi am o akman rana sang a tao am makongo so wanjin. Naknakmen nyo pala. Jyabo kaji nakdengan no ipasingsingkad na sya ni Ama ta do to a. "
1240098,"For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. ","Ta tamo katenngan o ciring na ni Ama ta do to a manci no, ""Amyan so ipasingkad ko so meyraraten a tao."" Maniring pa am, ""Ioya ko sira o marahet so iwawalam a omanod jyaken a tao."""
1240099,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.,Si Ama ta rana do to am to meyyonong a mavyay. Am ori o to da makasii no pasingsingtan na tao!
1240100,"But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; ",Manakem nyo no kakwa. Tana aro o alalaw nyo no kavayo nyo pa a omanoyong ji Yeso am jyabo kanimaharag nyo no alalaw nyo a. 
1240101,"partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. ",Tomakatakaw o kapasnesnek da jinyo a peyrarehten do tangain no aro a tao. Tomakatakaw o kapazasing da jinyo do peyrarehten da tao. 
1240102,"For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. ",Akma kamoy to macizanod so alalaw do paneban da tao. No katakaw da so kangangay nyo a nyahap no tao am mina to nyo peykabobwa do onowned nyo. Ta katenngan nyo o kapakahap nyo so apyapya pa a peymeymasaodan nyo do teyngato. 
1240103,"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. ",Am ori o ji nyo ablisi no onowned. Ta no si akman kamo sang so onowned am mahap nyo o rako a nakem na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. 
1240104,"For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.",Ji kamo macimazikna do vazay na ni Ama ta do to. Ta ori o ipakahap nyo so mina ciring na jinyo ni Ama ta do to no makwa. 
1240105,"For yet a little while, And he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.","Ta o ciring do Seysyo am, ""Maniring si Ama ta do to am, 'Makeykai rana a kapakaranes na rana no pananalahen nyo a mai. So ji na mapainini jya."
1240106,"Now the just shall live by faith: But if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.","O tao rana a omonot do nakenakem ko am mahap da o to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da do kanoyong da jyaken. Am o omlikod jyaken a tao am ji ko nakzan o akman sang.'"""
1240107,But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.,"Jyabo kapya ta so kapeydedna na jyaten no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to, do kalikod ta jya. Ta yaten rana am ta anoyngan o kapatazadang na jyaten ni Ama ta do to do teyngato."
1240108,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. ",O ipanganoyong rana ya am ipeyhanhan o vazay a ipeynanakem. O peypeypangayan no nang am anoyngan o kanoyong na myan no ji pa nimacita. 
1240109,For by it the elders obtained a good report.,O sarayan na no tao no kakwa ni Ama ta do to am nipeyhanhan da si Ama ta do to. 
1240110,"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. ",O ta ipakateneng do kaniomamamaog na ni Ama ta do to so karawan no ciring na am tana tamo jya nimacita am tamo na to nganoyngi o akman sang. So ikanoyong no yamacita eya nyamaog na ni Ama ta do to no ciring na.
1240111,"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. ","O nikapyapya na no nipatanang ni Yapo a kani Kayin ji Ama ta do to am nipeyhanhan na ni Yapo si Ama ta do to. Ori o nisarayan na nya ni Ama ta do to. Ori o nyabnekan na sya abo so raraten do tangain na, do kanoyong na meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to. Tana yana rana mownay si Yapo a nimawakwak am nitaid na jyaten o kakdeng ta a meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to."
1240112,"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. ","Si Inok rana am jya nimawakwak, ta mina to meytopos a nyahap na ni Ama ta do to, do kapeyhanhan na nya. So ji da rana nimakakalai sya no tao. Maniring do Seysyo am, ""No kaji na pa ngapan sya ni Ama ta do to am nimanmanma o kasaray na nya ni Ama ta do to."" "
1240113,"But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. ",No abo panganoyngan no tao am ji na narayan ni Ama ta do to. O mai do tangain ni Ama ta do to a tao am anoyngan da o keyyan ni Ama ta do to a macikaop jira a marilaw no komakzeb sya tao.
1240114,"By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. ","Si Noya rana am tana ji na pa nimacita o vazay am nyamizing na o nipaziman na sya ni Ama ta do to, do kapeyhanhan na ni Ama ta do to. Ori o nipamaring na so rako a avang. Ori o nikapya da asa ka vahay do henep, do katey rako no raraten no tao do karawan. So nikanoyong ni Noya a nibnek na ni Ama ta do to abo so raraten do tangain na, ta nipeyhanhan na si Ama ta do to."
1240115,"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. ",Si Apolahan rana am nionotan na si Ama ta do to do kapeyhanhan na nya. Am ori o nikarwan na do keymiminili da a mangay do tovoyan na sya ni Ama ta do to a pongso a itoro na jya ni Ama ta do to. Am no kakaro na do keymiminili da am ji na tenngi o angayan na. 
1240116,"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: ",Tana meyvahay do matarek a ili si Apolahan am nipeyhanhan na si Ama ta do to. So nipangilili na a meyvahay do akmey sarwap. Akman sang si Isa kani Yakebo. Ta meyyangangay sira a omapanala so mina ciring na sira ni Ama ta do to. 
1240117,"for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. ",Ta anoyngan na ni Apolahan o meypanam pa amaogen ni Ama ta do to a tey meymatek a ili do teyngato.
1240118,"Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. ","Tana rarakeh si Salay rana abo so kanen sospa am nimeytaodtod, do kapeyhanhan na ni Ama ta do to a mangononong do mina ciring na sya. "
1240119,"Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.",Tana rarakeh rana si Apolahan am akma raney mata no hanit a kano anay do pasalan o karwaro da no sivosivovoong na no makwa.
1240120,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. ",Sira rana ori am to da noiban do karawan o kapeyhanhan da ni Ama ta do to. Tana abo nimahap da do nipanci na ni Ama ta do to am da ji macimangsahi o da kapananala so akman sang a nakem na sira ni Ama ta do to. Da anoyngan o da kakmey mangilili a tao a yato ngiseysan do karawan. 
1240121,For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. ,O mapeyciring so sang a tao am manoyong sira meykala no kataotao da so vahay da do teyngato. 
1240122,"And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. ",So ji da rana naknakmi so nikarwan da ili. Ta no ikapaw da am apya pa o kapeysinaoli da. 
1240123,"But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.",O ikakza da am apyapya pa vahay do teyngato. Am ori o ji na macimanigi nira ni Ama ta do to no kapanci da nya Ama da do to. Ta amyan rana so hapan na sira ili.
1240124,"By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, ","No keyleylamdam na si Apolahan ni Ama ta do to a tomoro no anak na a meyngaran so Isa a wakwaken a patanangen ji Ama ta do to am ji na nikamama, do kapeyhanhan na nya. Ta ipeyhanhan na si Ama ta do to a manta nya so aro a sivosivovoong na. "
1240125,"of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: ","O mina ciring na jya ni Ama ta do to am, ""O apwapo mo am mapo ji Isa."""
1240126,"accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. ",Nipeyhanhan na ni Apolahan si Ama ta do to a mapaoli sya avyain si Isa. Am ori o ta pancyan ni Apolahan a nimahap si Isa do apwa kawakwakan na.
1240127,By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. ,"Si Isa rana am nipanlanlag na si Yakebo a kani Isaw, do kapeyhanhan na ni Ama ta do to a manta nira so ileylamnay da no nakem no makwa."
1240128,"By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff. ","No katod na rana jyawakwakan ni Yakebo am nipanlanlag na o rarwa ka anak ni Yoseyvo. So to na meysikoji a omraralay ni Ama ta do to, do kapeyhanhan na ni Ama ta do to."
1240129,"By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. ","Ikongo do ipeyhanhan na ni Yoseyvo si Ama ta do to, am toda jyawakwak am malavat na sira o kakaro da do Ayci no Isedi a tao a kapanci na rana nya jira so ahahapan da so totowang na a ibobo do peyyalislisan da ili."
1240130,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. ","Matazak si Moyse am macita da no inyapwan na o kapiya no kamahamahakay na. Karahan am mina katlo a vehan a nipowzib da. So ji da nimanyahei no ciring no panirsirngen, do kapeyhanhan da ni Ama ta do to."
1240131,"By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; ","Makaveyvow si Moyse am nitaosya na o kapanci da nya taodtod no anak ni Valaw a panirsirngen, do kapeyhanhan na ni Ama ta do to. "
1240132,"choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; ","Apyapyahen na pa o kapacitetngehan na no inawan na do italamozong na ni Ama ta do to a Isedi a tao a peyrarehten da, do kaji nakzan no kahap na so ji meyyonownay a sarasaray do vahay ni Valaw. "
1240133,esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. ,Apyapyahen na pa o kapeyrarahet na mahap so vazay no Misayya. So nilikodan na do aro a peymeymasaodan da no tao do Ayci a pamoonen da jya. Ta anoyngan na o kapyapya na pa no peymeymasaodan ni Ama ta do to a itoro na jya. 
1240134,"By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. ","Ji na nyaheyan o kapeyoyaoya na ni Valaw. So nikaro na do Ayci. Ta akma ney todacita no mata si Ama ta do to a yamacitovong jya. Am ori o ji na rana kei a meysinaoli, do kapeyhanhan na ni Ama ta do to. "
1240135,"Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. ","Ikongo do ipeyhanhan na si Ama ta do to ni Moyse, am ori o nipapwan na so Iyeci a kano omrarala so pazezevngen da a katodaliklikan so vahay da no Isedi a tao no tinsi a omwakwak so kabnekan da no tao do Ayci."
1240136,By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. ,"Akmey to mangonong sira do kacyan o Isedi a tao do rako a awa a ngaranan da so Mabazangbang awa, do kapeyhanhan da ni Ama ta do to. Am mangonong sira o tao do Ayci am nimamimin sira nipeytalama na no awa."
1240137,"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. ","Nilivolivon da no Isedi a tao o ili a meyngaran so Yedike so kapito araw a kazdazday na rana no ahad no ili da, do kapeyhanhan da ni Ama ta do to. "
1240138,"By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.","Ikongo do ipeyhanhan na si Ama ta do to no manakaw a mavakes a meyngaran si Laha, am ori o ji na nimacikazosoji jira kano aro a ji ngonot ji Ama ta do to a tao a mawakwak. Ta nitaotao na o nitovoy no Isedi a tao a omileylamdam so tao do Yedike."
1240139,"And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: ",Yaro pa dang o ciring ko am ko na ji mancyan si Cityan a kani Pala kani Sansong a kani Yevota kani Tawey a kani Samoar a kano aro a panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a tao. 
1240140,"who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, ","Ikongo do nipeyhanhan da si Ama ta do to, am ori o nipakahap da so mina ciring na jira a somidong sira. So nibalinasan da so tao do livolivon no ili da. So nikapiya na rana no nyahahapan da sya. So icyakma dey nisomengseng do ngongoy no kokoman so tao, do kapeyhanhan da ni Ama ta do to a somidong sira. "
1240141,"quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. ",So nihespan da do rako a lila no apoy. Nipakasaoy da do ipangan no tao a amwakwak sira. Kakwakwan da abo so oyowyat am nioyatan na sira ni Ama ta do to. So nikowyat da amharag so omarap sira tao do livolivon no ili da. 
1240142,"Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: ","O tatasa a mavavakes am mina to mirwa a mavyay o nimawakwak a makaop do asa ka vahay da, do kapeyhanhan da ni Ama ta do to. O tatasa ka tao am apyapyahen da pa o kaneb da jira kapakakasi da sira wakwaken, do kahap da so kapanganoyong da a meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to. Ta katenngan da o kapirwa da mavyay no makwa. "
1240143,"and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: ",Tatasa jira to myapya so kapeyzeyzozomyak da jira a bakbakan. So iyan no nivaod da kano nyaneban da. 
1240144,"they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; ",Amyan so tao a nibhebhesan da nimawakwak. Amyan so nigetget da nipeyketeb so kataotao. Amyan so nizakat da no ipangan. Amyan so meyyayob so kolit no kagling a vovwan da limanen a paksozen. So to da liliwi so kakcinan da kano peyrarehtan da sira pakakasin. 
1240145,"(of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.","So ikapyapya na rana no kaji da macivahayan jira no apya so nakenakem a tao, do kateywara no pacioyyan da do manaralay a tao. So ikanoyong da akmey minaminasbang a to meyyowyaw do peycyeylilyan na kado kahasan. So to da rana pavyavingi so kataotao da do azcizcip."
1240146,"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: ",Sira rana ori am admain na sira ni Ama ta do to o makdeng so nakem a tao. Am abo nimahap da mina ciring na sira ni Ama ta do to no kavyay da pa. 
1240147,"God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.",Ta amyan so nipamnekan na ni Ama ta do to a apyapya pa a itoro na jyaten. Ori rana am pehzahen na sira jyaten a makahap so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da do teyngato a yazaw na sira.
1240148,"Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, ",So yada ikatey yaro no tao a ta rana nimacita so kakdekdeng a meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to no kakwa. Am ori an o akasan ta na so makakaday a ikasengseng jyaten a kano raraten ta yakmey omvaod jyaten a kowyat ta so onowned a akman so malayo a ji macimaza do palaywan na angayan. 
1240149,"looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. ",To ta peyyononga a peyyanen do onowned ta si Yeso Kizisto. Ta iya rana am nimapapo so kapeyhanhan ta ni Ama ta do to. So ika iya na no mapeynyangavosan syaha. Ji na nikamama o jyojika do tangain na. To na nazibwan o peyleylakan da sya a wakwaken do jyojika. Ta katenngan na o kapeyvoga no sarasaray na no makwa. So na rana ilisna do wanan na ni Ama ta do to sicyaikwaya.
1240150,"For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. ",Naknakmen nyo o mina vazay na to nomok so avavay da sya no meyraraten a tao. Ta ori o ji nyo a vokahawi no ingalaw da jinyo. 
1240151,"Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. ",Ta kamo pa ji nimangay so inawan a yamacilimaliman ji Satan a yamapeyraraten jinyo. 
1240152,"And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, Nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:","Manngwa, nyo na todahamangi o na ivavaga jinyo akman so inyapwan a amvavaga do anak na? Ta no maniring am, ""Imo rana anak ko am azimanen mo o nanao ni Ama ta do to. Ji ka todarahet rana so onowned a nanawen na."
1240153,"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.","Ta si Ama ta do to am vavagan na sira o ikarilaw na tao. Nanawen na sira o abneken na anak."""
1240154,"If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? ",Ahapen nyo o inanao na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. Ta o nanawan na jinyo am anak na inyo an. Ta abo inyapwan a ji nanao so anak. 
1240155,"But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. ",No si ji kamo nanao am ji kamo meyngongyod a anak na. 
1240156,"Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? ","O meysinogat a ama ta do karawan am ta hapen o nanao da. So tamo kanigan nira. Am imanngo rana si Ama ta do teyngato. Jya mahamahama pa o onotan ta jya, do kahap ta so ikavyay no pahad ta. "
1240157,"For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. ",O meysinogat a ama ta do karawan am to da mangozai o ahahapan da sya amnanao jyaten. Am alinged ori an. Am o nanawan na jyaten ni Ama ta do to am ipeypapya na jyaten.

1240158,"Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

1240211,"For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.","No domada o araw a kazidangdang no sinazawsaw na am ji meyyahahay a mahayo.

1240212,"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.

1240220,for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. ,No meyoyaoya o tao am ji na rana tenngi a peyvazain o apya vazay a isaray na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240221,"Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. ","Am ori an, vonasan nyo so marahet a nakenakem nyo a kano marahet a icicirawat nyo a omonot ji Ama ta do to a omahap so ciriciring na a na akmey nipamowa do onowned nyo a mapatazadang jinyo do teyngato."
1240222,"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. ",Taosya o kamizing so ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a ji peyvazaya. Ta o akman rana sang am alalasan o kataotao. 
1240223,"For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: ","O kamizing sya a ji mapeyvazay sya am akman so tao a tomita so avwavong na do kagami, "
1240224,"for he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. ","a makapengkad so lolit no moing na, kato na rana angayan, ji na rana nakem o kapeyramon na. "
1240225,"But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. ",Am beken a kamizing ta so Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. Ta peyvazain ta o nimamizing ta a Ciriciring na a yamapahawa jyaten do peyraratenan ta.

1240226,"If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain. ",No myan so tao a mapakakdekdeng so nakem ji Ama ta do to a kaji na amzatan do ciring na am alalasan na o kataotao na. So ikabo no peypeypangayan na no kararalay na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240227,"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.","O ipanci na ni Ama ta do to a manoyong a omraralay nya tao am ji manginanahet do nimasbang a kano vao a mavakes a makapzat do onowned na, ji macikza do tao do karawan a meyraraten."
1240228,"My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. ","Manga kakteh, no kamo manoyong a yamraralay ni Yeso Kizisto a yatey mazway a Panirsirngen ta am taosya o kapeycyakaban nyo so tao. "
1240229,"For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; ",No amyan so meynakem a tao a meygagaling so ovay a meyyayob so apipiya ayob a makaranes do panaralayan nyo a kai no makasi a tao a mapisipising so ayob am 
1240230,"and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: ","no si teywara o anyanig mo so apiya so ayob a tao a manci no, ""Lisna do jya, mo keypong,"" a kapanci mo nya do makasi a tao so, ""Kangay mo do kwang a amlisna."" "
1240231,"are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? ","No si makman kamo sang am malas o nakenakem nyo, do kapeycyakaban nyo so tao."
1240232,"Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? ",Amizngen nyo manga keypong an. Na nitenngan ni Ama ta do to sira o makasi a tao do karawan a makdeng so nakem a omraralay nya. So da ikanoyong a makahap so nakem na sira ni Ama ta do to a macikaop rana do italamozong na. 
1240233,"But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? ",Am inyo rana am nyo panyanigen sira o yamakasi a tao. Am o yamapasnesnek jinyo a yamangay ninyo do pacicicyan am sira o katenngan a tao a yaro so nizpi. 
1240234,Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? ,Sira rana o katenngan a tao a aro so nizpi am da rehrehten o mazway a ngaran ni Yeso Kizisto a nyo pacingaranan.
1240235,"If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: ","No si manoyong kamo a mangozay do ciring do Seysyo am, ""To mo mangozai o aryarilaw mo so kataotao mo a marilaw no icyatatao mo."" Ta ori rana am ney makdeng na a iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to. No si peyvazain nyo ori am manoyong kamo na so ahahapan sya. "
1240236,"but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. ",Am no si mapeycyakaban kamo so tao am raraten nyo ori. So ikanoyong nyo a pazasingen no iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to do meyraraten a tao. 
1240237,"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. ",Tana asa nipasobnan no tao do iwawalam am akma ney to zagoma o iwawalam a nipasobnan. 
1240238,"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. ",Ta o yamanci no kaji mapasagpyanan so kataotao am ipanci na o kaji mangapan so tao. Tana ji ka mangap so tao a kasagpyan mo so aktokto am pavilangen na imo a meyraraten a mapasobna do iwawalam na ni Ama ta do to.
1240239,"So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. ","Am ori an, apzatan ta do ciring ta kano icicirawat ta. Ta katenngan ta o kapacici na jyaten ni Ama ta do to. Am cyaha, ji ta nyaheyan, ta onotan ta o Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a yamapahawa jyaten do peyraratenan ta. "
1240240,"For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.",Ta no mapacici si Ama ta do to am ji na arilawan sira o ji mangarilaw a tao.

1240241,"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?

1240242,"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, ","No myan jinyo so akma nyoy kakteh do cinai a ji makarapya do kanen da abo so ayob am, "

1240244,"Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. ",Akman sang o nakenakem ta si Ama ta do to. Ta no ji ta patwawa do icicirawat ta am akmey ji ta manaralay a tao.

1240249,"Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? ",Si Apolahan rana am no mangay o kapeyhanhan na ni Ama ta do to am mangay o kapatwaw na sya do vazay na. 
1240250,"And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. ","Nimangononong rana o ciring eya, ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Nipeyhanhan na ni Apolahan si Ama ta do to.

1240259,"And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.

1240264,Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? ,O atbod am ji voyog dang o makopad a kano maganinem a ranom. 
1240265,"Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.","O acyai, manga kakteh, am ji meyyasi so vineveh. O vazacinok am ji meyyasi so anyoy. O attaw am ji voyog dang o matavang a ranom."
1240266,Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. ,Sino jinyo o yamateneng a tao. No si myan am apyapya o kapehbo na so nakem na a mapeyvazay so apiya vazay.

1240344,"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; ",O ko ipanci pa jinyo manga keypong am tamo akmey miseysan do karawan. Ji nyo to ngonongonongi o nakenakem nyo. Ta o marahet a onowned ta am ipeyparai ta ji Ama ta do to.

1240346,"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. ","Am ori an, onotan nyo do makayokod ninyo a tao do karawan, do kapanadnad nyo si Ama ta do to.

1240351,"For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. ",No abo kalasan nyo a to nazibwan no peyrarehtan da jinyo am isaray na o akman sang ni Ama ta do to. Ta onowned nyo am ahapen nyo o vazay na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240352,"For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. ","No si kalasan mo o bakbakan da jimo a kato mo liliwan sya am cyaha, ta kalasan mo o akman sang. Am no abo o kalasan mo a kato da oyyan nimo a kato mo peykabobwan sya am cyaha, ta isaray na o akman sang ni Ama ta do to. "
1240353,"For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: ",Ori o peypeypangayan na no na panopan jinyo ni Ama ta do to. Ta akman sang si Yeso Kizisto a nimanngannga ninyo. So inaran nyo sya a to nazibo no alalaw nyo. 
1240354,"who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: ",Abo o raraten na. Abo o malas a ciring na.
1240355,"who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: ",No kavay da sya am abo o asa ka ciring na nipasapan na jira. No kapeyyalilima da jya am abo o asa ka ciring na yalalaw na sira. Ta kapasyasi na ji Ama ta do to a yamapeyyangangay so tao. 
1240356,"who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. ",Nisabway na ni Kizisto o raraten ta do jyojika. Ori o karwan ta na do peyraratenan ta a somazap so isaray na vazay ni Ama ta do to. O kataotao na ni Yeso a yanimanngannga nyaten am yata nipakahap so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta. 
1240357,For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.,Kamo akmey mavozaw a kagling a ji makateneng do rarahan. Am na rana nipaoli inyo. So yanyo ipacilolo rana jya a yana apzatan so pahad.
1240358,"Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; ","Inyo rana mavakes am onotan nyo o kahanghangan nyo. Ta no si amyan jira ori so ji nganoyong do Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to am anoyngan da rana, do pakacittan da so apiya icicirawat nyo. So ikapyapya no apya icicirawat nyo a kano aro a ciring nyo a inanao nyo sira. "
1240359,while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. ,Ta macita da o kapiya no icicirawat nyo a kano kakdekdeng nyo amraralay ni Ama ta do to. 
1240360,"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; ",Taosya o kapeyhahama nyo no avok nyo a kano ovaovay nyo a kano aywayob nyo. 
1240361,"but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. ",Ta ney makdeng o kapiya no onowned nyo. Ta o tey yapya so nakenakem do icyatatao na ji makazyazyak a mangay do ikararakehan na am tey mazway o akman sang do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240362,"For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: ",Ta sira rana meyhanhan ni Ama ta do to a mavakes no kakwa am akman sang o ahahapan da so kataotao da a omonot do kahanghangan da. 
1240363,"even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.",O meyngaran so Salay mavakes am akman so sang a niomonot do kahanghangan na a meyngaran si Apolahan. Abneken na o kahanghangan na meymatmatngeh nya. No si manoyong kamo a apiya so icicirawat a jyanyahey no makakaday a vazay am manoyong kamo a akma ney anak ni Salay.
1240364,"Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.","Inyo rana mahakay a katovong da am panadnaden nyo sira o katovong nyo do vahay a mavakes, do kaji da macingayan jinyo so kolit. Ori an, kanigan nyo nira. Ta meyyangay kamo a makahap so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad nyo. No si mahap nyo o akman sang am abo ji na ngamizing a inozi nyo ni Ama ta do to."
1240365,"Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: ",Ko pakoyokoin jinyo am akma kamoy asa so ahahapan sya masicyakarilaw. Akman so aryarilaw nyo so kakteh nyo o karilawan nyo no akma nyoy kakteh do cinai. Makapiya kamo so nakem do kadwan jinyo. Masicyakanig kamo. 
1240366,"not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. ",Ji nyo patonggali o karatan no kadwan jinyo. Ji kamo masyavavay. Ta kaovayovay nyo so kadwan jinyo. Ta no kapanop na jinyo ni Ama ta do to am akman so sang o nakenakem na jinyo. 
1240367,"ForHe that will love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile:","Akman so ciring do Seysyo. Maniring am, ""No kakzeben o kasaray do karawan am taosya o kapatwaw so marahet a ciring. Taosya o kapangalalas."
1240368,"Let him eschew evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and ensue it.",Ney yapya na am peymakarwan na o marahet a vazay na a kasazap na so apiya vazay. To na noiban do karawan o kapiya na so nakem do icyatatao na.
1240369,"For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, And his ears are open unto their prayers: But the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.","Ta singkadan na ni Ama ta do to o ji meylimoteng so onowned a tao. Amizngen na o inozi da. Ji na nidonga o meyraraten a tao."""
1240370,"And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? ",Sino to makagogad ninyo no si meyngongyod kamo a somazap so apya vazay. 
1240371,"But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; ",Tana meyrarahet kamo do kanoyngan nyo am somaray kamo. Ji nyo anyaheyan o tatasa ka tao a omalalaw jinyo. Ji kamo a rahet so onowned.
1240372,but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: ,"Ji kamo a haha so nakem ji Kizisto. Iraralay nyo a panadnaden o Panirsirngen nyo. Mangday kamo do araraw a omnakenakem so itovis nyo do mapacici jinyo, do raralayan nyo ni Ama ta do to a mapatazadang jinyo do teyngato. "
1240373,"having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. ","Am panalawbowen nyo o nakem nyo a tomovis do akman sang a tao. Ji kamo meylimoteng so onowned a kanig da no mapanyanig jinyo, do kapiya no icicirawat nyo a omahap so nanao ni Kizisto. "
1240374,"For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing. ",No nakenakem ni Ama ta do to o kapeyrarahet da jinyo do kanoyngan nyo am cyaha. Ta apyapya rana ori a kano peyrarehtan da jinyo do kalasan nyo. 
1240375,"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: ","Ta ipisa si Yeso Kizisto a nimawakwak no raraten ta, kapakavos na rana so vazay na a mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato. So ikanoyong na abo so raraten a nisomabway no raraten no tao, do na kapanop jyaten ji Ama ta do to. Tana niwakwak da o kataotao na am jya nimawakwak o pahad na. "
1240376,by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; ,Nioyatan no Seyzi o pahad ni Yeso a mangay a mapamizing so pahad no nimawakwak rana tao. 
1240377,"which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. ",Sira rana am ji da nyanoyngan si Ama ta do to no kapamaring na ni Noya so avang na. Kakwakwan da ji manganoyong am ji na nikahayo sira ni Ama ta do to a nanalahen a mamlis. Tana wawao sira o nisomdep do avang ni Noya am nivyay na sira ni Ama ta do to do rako a henep. 
1240378,"The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, ) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: ",O henep rana am kehngehngay na no ranom a da itaktak jyaten do kyokay. Am sicyaikwa rana ya am nyo rana ipeyhanhan si Yeso Kizisto a nimirwa a mavyay a mapatazadang jinyo do teyngato. So ji na monganai do kanownaw no kataotao nyo. Ta monganay jyaten a manci nya ji Ama ta do to so kanoyong ta na mahap so vazay na. 
1240379,"who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.",Yana myan si Yeso Kizisto do teyngato a yamlisna do wanan ni Ama ta do to a yatomalamozong no tinsi. So ji da makapeysopoi do oyowyat ni Kizisto no makakaday do teyngato.
1240380,"Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; ","Manoyong o kanimanngannga na ninyo ni Yeso Kizisto. Am ori an, no manngannga kamo do raralayan nyo ni Yeso Kizisto a kato nyo liliwan sya a makanakem si Kizisto a nisomabway no raraten nyo am manoyong kamo na nikomaro do peyraratenan nyo. "
1240381,"that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. ","Pamindahen nyo rana sicyaikwaya o kaji nyo rana mangozayan do malas a monganay jinyo a onowned nyo. Ta o apyahen na ni Ama ta do to o ahapen nyo, do ipeyigegen nyo pa do karawan. "
1240382,"For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: ","Teywara o mina raraten nyo no kakwa. Ta meyyangay kamo pa so vazay a kano ji raralay ni Ama ta do to a tao a to meyvozaw a mapasagpyan so aktokto nyo a masakisakin, manaralay so malas a tao do to nyo, pacyangayan no makakaday a raraten nyo. "
1240383,"wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: ","So yada na savasavakan ninyo no yaji manaralay a tao, do yanyo na kaji macikaopan jira a somagpyan so vazay. Am ori o da kazyakan ninyo. "
1240384,who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. ,"Am cyaha, ta mangay o kasazap da si Ama ta do to a yamapeykapyapinpin so mavyay a kano nimawakwak a tao. "
1240385,"For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.",Ori o yarana nipamizngan no Mapasaray a Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to so yarana nimawakwak a tao. Ta tana meyyangangay o tao a tana mawakwak a komaro do karawan am o pahad da no nimraralay ni Ama ta do to am macitovong ji Ama ta do to do teyngato.
1240386,"But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. ",Yarana masngen o ikavos no karawan. Makowyowyat kamo pa omzat do onowned no kataotao nyo. Ta ori o ikabo no raraten a makazazat do inozi nyo. 
1240387,And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. ,O ney makdeng na am ikarilaw nyo o kadwan jinyo. Ta o pangarilawan rana am mapeyyopowpas so makakaday a pasicyakaoyyan ta do karawan. 
1240388,Use hospitality one to another without grudging. ,Masaray kamo a tomaotao so omatao jinyo a tao. Taosya o kaoya nyo so aktokto a amrapong sira. 
1240389,"As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. ",To ta mangozai o teneteneng a nitoro na jyaten ni Ama ta do to a somidong so tao. 
1240390,"If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.",O meylimwang no Ciriciring ni Ama ta do to am Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to o malavat da. No manidong ta so icyatatao ta am ipeyhanhan ta si Ama ta do to a tomoro no oyowyat na jyaten.

Amin.
1240391,"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: ","Manga keypong, ji nyo ngyakan o keyyan no makdeng a alalaw nyo a ileylamdam na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. Ta kangay na ori no alalaw ta amraralay ni Ama ta do to a tao. "
1240392,"but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. ",Kasaray nyo a macizanod so alalaw ji Kizisto. Ta ori o ikasaray nyo no mai rana si Kizisto. 
1240393,"If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. ",Masaray kamo no amyan so peyleylakan da jinyo a mahap so vazay ni Kizisto. Ta padnadnahen na o nakem nyo no Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to a yamyan jinyo. 
1240394,"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. ",Inaoy no si ji monganay do panwakwakan nyo so tao a kano panakawan nyo a kano peyvonagan nyo so tao a kano kazyakan nyo no icyatatao nyo o yapwan no alalaw nyo. 
1240395,"Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. ",Am no amyan so alalaw nyo do kapanaralay nyo am ji nyo macimasnekan. Isaray nyo ji Ama ta do to o yanyo kapacikazway do ngaran ni Kizisto.
1240396,"For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? ",Yarana marateng sicyaikwaya o araraw no yana ipeykapyapinpin so tao ni Ama ta do to. Am papwen na do omanoyong jya tao o pacicin na.

1240398,"Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.","Am ori an, no si nakem na ni Ama ta do to o kapakasazi da no tao so alalaw am ji da macimazai o kapanidong da so tao. Ta ipeyhanhan da si Ama ta do to a nimangamaog so tao do karawan a makasidong sira."
1240399,"The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: ",Inyo rana yakman jyaken a cyozo do kyokay am ko ipanci jinyo o kanimakacita ko si Yeso Kizisto a nipeyrarahet da kawakwak da sya. Ko ipanci jinyo o azwazway ta no makwa do teyngato. 
1240400,"feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; ",Pakapyahen nyo sira nanawen o akma ney kagling ni Ama ta do to a yana nitoro jinyo a yaponged nyo. Am taosya o kasalit nyo so onowned a mapeyveyveken sira. Beken a no panizpin da inyo o ipeyvazay nyo. Ta manoyong o kasaray no onowned nyo a somidong sira. 
1240401,"neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. ",Taosya o kapeymetdeh nyo so nitoro na jinyo ni Ama ta do to a yaponged nyo a akma ney kagling. Ta peycitacittan da o apiya vazay nyo nira. 
1240402,"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. ",Ta no si makaranes rana o araraw ni Yeso Kizisto a yaomaponged ninyo am manoyong o kapakahap nyo rana so yazaw na jinyo a to meyyonong a azwazway nyo do teyngato.
1240403,"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. ","Inyo rana a malalavayo a tao am onotan nyo o apya ciring da jinyo no rarakeh. So ko to zagomi jinyo a yapancyan no kapaveveh nyo so aktokto nyo a somidong so vazay no kadwan jinyo. Ta maniring do Seysyo am, ""Ji na nidonga ni Ama ta do to o mapahama so nakem na tao. Apyapyahen na pa sidongen sira o mapaveveh so nakem da tao."""
1240404,"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: ",Pavevehen nyo o nakem nyo do tangain ni Ama ta do to. Ta amyan so araraw na no pakatkatan na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. 
1240405,casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. ,To nyo mimina o alalaw nyo a itoro ji Ama ta do to. Ta iya o makasidong jinyo.
1240406,"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: ",Meypepzat kamo. Taosya o kakma nyoy mitkeh so onowned. Ta si Satan a kavosoyan nyo am yakmey kokoman so tao a yaji yakneng do na yanan a yameykala so tao a na kanen a na pasyain so nakem ji Ama ta do to. 
1240407,"whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. ",Pahadpeten nyo o nakem si Ama ta do to. Likodan nyo o vazay ni Satan. Ta nyo katenngan sira o akma nyoy kakteh do cinai a yakman jinyo a yamakasazi so alalaw da a yamraralay ni Ama ta do to. 
1240408,"But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. ","Si Ama ta do to am yana yapwan no rako a pangangarilawan, do na kapazanod jinyo do azwazway na. Ta inyo rana am kamo rana macikaop ji Kizisto.

1240409,To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.,Inaoy no si mangay o azwazway a kano oyowyat ji Ama ta do to a mangay do kaidan no karawan! Amin.
1240410,"By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. ",O teygami rana ya am si Sila akma tey kakteh do cinai o yanisomidong jyaken a yameyteygami ninyo. Ta ko katenngan o na katey makdeng so nakem ji Yeso Kizisto. Ko paiten inyo.

1240412,Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.,"Ipeyminaminasi nyo o kadwan jinyo, do kapasicyakarilaw nyo amraralay ni Ama ta do to. Inaoy no si mamimin kamo a makahap so ikapiya no onowned nyo a meyhanhan ni Kizisto."
1240413,"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: ","Yaken rana am si Simong Pite ko a nipamnekan na ni Yeso Kizisto a amlivolivon no ciriciring na a lamlamsoy na.

1240414,"grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, ","Inaoy si itoro na ni Ama ta do to a kani Yeso a Panirsirngen ta o pangangarilawan na kano ikapiya no onowned nyo, do yanyo kanoyong a yarana makateneng ji Ama ta do to a kani Yeso Kizisto."
1240415,"according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: ","Na rana nipazanod yaten ni Ama ta do to no oyowyat na, akma ney anak do karawan. Am ori o ji tamo meylimotengi so onowned do araraw.

1240416,"whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. ",do na kapangononong do mina ciring na jyaten. Ori o ikanoyong nyo a komaro do ikeykakza nyo a monganay jinyo a tao do karawan a macikaop rana ji Ama ta do to a ji meylimoteng so onowned.
1240417,"And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; ",Ori o ikowyowyat nyo pa mapeypahagnat so nakem ji Ama ta do to. Ta ori o ikapya na no icicirawat nyo. Meypahagnat kamo so aktokto. Ta ori o ipakazab nyo so nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240418,and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; ,Apzatan nyo o onowned nyo do icyatatao nyo. Meypahagnat kamo so onowned a ji mapeyyan do onowned nyo so makakaday a alalaw. Ta ori o ikakdeng nyo rana so nakem a amraralay ni Ama ta do to. 
1240419,and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. ,Makakdekdeng kamo pa omraralay ni Ama ta do to a marilaw no akma nyoy kakteh do cinai. Inarahen nyo si Ama ta do to so pangarilawan a marilaw no aro a tao. 
1240420,"For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. ","Mamimin ori a ahapen nyo. Ta ori o iyan no peypeypangayan no kararalay nyo ni Kizisto, do kapakateneng nyo rana ji Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta. "
1240421,"But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. ","O ji mangononong do akman sang a vazay a tao am akmey mavota, do kato na rana makahamangan do mina kavonas na rana no raraten na no kakwa."
1240422,"Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: ","Ori an manga kakteh an, ipakowyowyat nyo pa a mapeyyan sya do onowned nyo so mina kapamnek na jinyo ni Ama ta do to. Ta no si akman kamo sang am jyabo kapeyparai nyo ji Ama ta do to a, "
1240423,for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.,a macikaop rana do to meyyonong a italamozong na ni Yeso Kizisto a Panirsirngen ta a mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato.
1240424,"Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. ",Tana nyo na katenngan o yamakakaday a vazay eya a yarana mapeyyan so nanao na ni Ama ta do to do onowned nyo am ko ji macimazai o ko kapaziman jinyo. 
1240425,"Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; ",Do ko iyan pa do karawan am jyabo kapacimaza ko jinyo a vavagan a peyparakwen so nakenakem a. 
1240426,"knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. ","Ko na makazazap o kakeykai na rana no kataotao ko a komaro do karawan, do kanimapaziman na rana sya jyaken ni Yeso Kizisto. "
1240427,Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. ,"Jyabo o kapacimaza ko do yamakakaday a nanao na ni Ama ta do to a ipamizing jinyo a, a kaji nyo rana makahamangan jya, do italikan ko rana do karawan."
1240428,"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. ",Beken a namen to mangamaog so kavavatanen a namen ipamizing jinyo a yamanci no keypirwa na mai ni Yeso Kizisto a yatey mowyat a Panirsirngen ta. Ta manoyong o kanimakacita namen sya a tey mazway a Tao do to. 
1240429,"For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. ","No kapeydedna na so azwazway ni Ama ta do to ji Yeso Kizisto am nimyan namen do dang. Nimapo do teyngato o ciring na ni Ama ta do to. Maniring am, ""Iya rana am Anak ko ya a yako ikaglaw."" "
1240430,"And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. ",Manoyong o kanimakamizing namen so ciring na ni Ama ta do to a apo do teyngato no kapacihza namen ji Yeso no keyyan namen do tokon.
1240431,"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: ","Ori o yanamen ji palasi so ciring a yada ipeylimwang no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a tao. So pakamyamizngan nyo pala so ciring ang. Ta ori rana am yakmey zampo ori a yatomiray so kasarisaryan, mangay do idada na rana no araw do madagdag. So icyakman na sang si Yeso a omzezak so onowned nyo a mangay do araraw no yai na rana. "
1240432,"knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. ",O ney makdeng na am ji nyo to ngonongonongi a pehtawen o ciring no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to do Seysyo. 
1240433,For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.,Ta o ciring no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a tao am beken a monganay jira. Ta o oyowyat no Seyzi o nisomidong sira. So ikanoyong no ciring da apo ji Ama ta do to.
1240434,"But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. ","No kakwa do Isedi am amyan so nimalas so ipangnanao a tao. Akman sang jinyo, ta no makwa am amyan so malas so ciring a tao. Sira rana am ipeylimwang da o iparai no pahad nyo ji Ama ta do to, mangay ji Yeso Kizisto a nimawakwak nira o alalasan da. Am o akman rana sang a tao am ji meyyahahay o kapeydedna na jira no oyaoyyan na nira ni Ama ta do to. "
1240435,And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. ,Tana somagpyan sira am amyan so aro a tao a macilolo jira a mapasagpyan so nakenakem da. So ikanoyong no nanao na ni Ama ta do to a pasagsagpyanen da no tao. 
1240436,"And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. ",Sira rana malas so ipangnanao a tao am mangamaog sira so ciriciring a ipeylimwang da ipangap da so apzapzatan no tao a ikadpeh jira. So iyan na rana no kakwa no oyyan na nira ni Ama ta do to. So ikanoyong da rana ji rana makasaway do pasingsingtan na jira ni Ama ta do to.
1240437,"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; ",O nimeyraraten a tinsi am ji na vonasa o raraten da. Ta nipangay na sira do kararatan. So nilyowan na sira aptengen do kasarisaryan a yamapanala so araraw ni Ama ta do to a mapeykapyapinpin so tao. 
1240438,"and spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; ","Ji na nipeykabobo o raraten da no tao no kakwa. Ori o nipeykehnepan na sya a ibalinas na so ji mapanadnad si Ama ta do to a tao. Wawao sira Noya asa ka vahay a nivyay ni Ama ta do to, do kaji na nimapasalan do ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to a ipeylimwang do tao. "
1240439,"and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; ",Nibalinas na ni Ama ta do to o tao do adwa ka ili a meyngaran so Sotoma kano Hamola. Ori o nipakasan na so apoy a itemtem na sira a ipacita na so ji manganwanoyong a tao. 
1240440,"and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: ","Nivyay na o meyngaran so Lote, do kapya no onowned na. Iya rana am ikarahet na no onowned sira o meyraraten a tao. "
1240441,"(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) ","Tey meyngen o onowned na a makacita so raraten da do araraw no meyraraten a tao, do kapacikeylyan na jira. "
1240442,"the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: ",Am katenngan na ni Ama ta do to a pahawahen sira o jyablis so onowned a makanakem sya a tao do alalaw da. So ipakateneng na ni Ama ta do to do meyraraten a tao a pasingsingtan no marateng o araraw na no peykapyapinpinan na so tao. 
1240443,"but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. ",Tarek pa sira o to mangozangozay do onowned da a ji mapanadnad so oyowyat ni Ama ta do to. Ta jyabo kaji nakdekdengan pa no pasingsingtan na jira. Pahamahen da o nakem da no malas so ipangnanao a tao a ji mapanadnad so tinsi na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240444,"Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.",Kakwakwan da no tinsi arakorako pa so oyowyat a ka nira am ji dadkeci sira rehrehten no ciriciring da do tangain na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240445,"But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; ","Am o malas so ipangnanao a tao am sya akmey omalalam a yaji makateneng do kasnekan da a yamapananala so omwakwak sira a tao. Da ikazyak o yada jyatenngi a vazay. So ikanoyong na mangay jira no peyoyaoyyan na ni Ama ta do to, "
1240446,"and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the daytime. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you; ","do kalas no vazay da do icyatatao da. O abneken da ney yapya na vazay am azwain da o kataotao da, abo so ji peyveyvazaya do maraw. So nyo ikanoyong a yamacikatamwad jira do da kapacizavoz jinyo. Ta sira rana am da isaray da kapanlita so tao. "
1240447,"having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: ",Yabo da ji nitanita no mata da. Da pa ji makamyamyan o yamakakaday a yada peyraratenan. Da cirarahen sira o yaji makanet so onowned ji Ama ta do to a tao a mapasagpyan so kataotao da. Sira rana am da inaman o yada pangangagoman. So da ikanoyong a yana balinasen ni Ama ta do to. 
1240448,"which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; ","Da peymakarwan o apiya rarahan. So da ikanoyong a yamavozaw a yaominara so anak ni Peyley a meyngaran so Palang. Iya rana am ikeykakza na pa o keyyan no nizpi na, ji na ngezsangan o kapeyraraten na. "
1240449,but was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet. ,So nioyyan na nya ni Ama ta do to do raraten na. Ori o mina to na meyzezyaki rana no baka a kaoranan na amwoya nya a omzazat do malas a vazay na.
1240450,"These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. ",Sira rana o malas so ipangnanao a tao am akman sira so matdes a atbod a kabwan rana no ranom. So icyakma dey pavyoten no pagpag a cinalab a kabwan no maciralay a cimoy. Mangay o kapangayan na sira ni Ama ta do to do rako a kasarisaryan. 
1240451,"For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. ",Sira rana am sya mapatwaw so rako a ciring a tomirara so vayo pa niomtad no peyraratenan da tao. 
1240452,"While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. ","Ipanci da o kapeypapya da no macilolo jira. Am jyakman sang, ta kapasagpyan da so icicirawat da. So ikanoyong no macihza jira tao a kalamsoyan no makakaday, do katalamozong na nira no raraten. "
1240453,"For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. ","No si amyan so tao a makateneng do Panirsirngen ta si Yeso Kizisto a mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato a kanikomaro na rana do makakaday a raraten do karawan, a kaoli na pa so mina raraten na am arakorako pa o kanginanawan na no nang. "
1240454,"For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. ",O to ngaro do apyahen na vazay ni Ama ta do to amraralay nya am apyapya rana kaji na nimakamizngan so Ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240455,"But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.","Manoyong o ciring da no tao no kakwa. Ta maniring sira am, ""O niota da no ino am mangay da olin a kanen."" Akman sang o kois, ta no teyka rana sira aryosen am meyoli pa sira marios do kahethetkan."
1240456,"This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: ","Manga kakteh, oya rana am ikadwa na ya no teygami ko jinyo. Yameynanod yadwa ka teygami a yana adketan no ciring a yako ipaziman jinyo, a yako ivavaga jinyo a peyparakwen so nakenakem. "
1240457,"that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: ",Inaoy si mamimin nyo peyyanen do onowned nyo o mina ciring da no panoyonoywan na so ciring ni Ama ta do to a kano mina ciring na ni Yeso a Panirsirngen ta a mapatazadang jyaten do teyngato a ninanao da jinyo no nipamnekan na a omlivolivon no ciriciring na. 
1240458,"knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, ",O ney makdeng na am manakem nyo o keyyan no to mangozangozay do onowned da tao a meykeykaming ninyo do pangavosan no karawan. 
1240459,"and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. ","No maniring sira am, ""Wanjin na kai ni Kizisto a manci no kai na asyo. Sira rana nimeykawakwakwak a ineynapo ta am wanjin o na kablis no nyamaog na karawan."" "
1240460,"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: ",To da nazibwan o kanimamaog na ni Ama ta do to so hanit a kano karawan no ciring na. O tana eya am nimeytotwaw apo do ranom a kapeypinpin na rana sya. 
1240461,"whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: ",Nipangamaog na ni Ama ta do to o ranom so karawan. Nibalinas na no ranom o karawan. 
1240462,"but the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.","Am sicyaikwaya am yajyablis o hanit a kano teyrahem, do yana kahad sya no ciring na ni Ama ta do to, mangay do itemtem na so hanit a kano karawan a kano ji manganoyong a tao, no marateng rana o araraw no ipeykapyapinpin na so tao ni Ama ta do to."
1240463,"But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. ","Am ji nyo a hamangi o meykasa vazay, manga kakteh an. Tana kasaraw a tana makazivo awawan am meyyangay ori ji Ama ta do to. "
1240464,"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. ",O nakenakem ni Ama ta do to a kano tao am ji meyyangay. Ta si Ama ta do to am ji mapainin do mina ciring na. Ta tana inyo am akman sang a na jyahaywan a pananalahen a yamamlis. Ta ji na mamyapyan o asa ka tao do karawan a mangay do kararatan. Ta ikakza na o kamimin no tao a mamlis a komaro do raraten da.
1240465,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. ",Am o araraw no yai na no Panirsirngen ta am jyaziman a akmey manakaw a tao. No si marateng o araraw ori am meykaing a matemtem do kakavos no karawan a kabo na rana no sinokob no hanit a kano teyrahem a matemtem no rako a lila no apoy. So ikabo na rana no masaod no karawan. 
1240466,"Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, ","No si manoyong o kakman na sang a mabalinas no makakaday am makongo kamo so wanjin a tao. Am ori an, kakzan nyo no ji meylimoteng so onowned a tao a omraralay ni Ama ta do to, "
1240467,"looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? ",a omapananala so araraw ni Ama ta do to a ji meyyahahay a makaranes. No si marateng o araraw ori am matemtem o masaod no hanit. So ikabo na rana no masaod no hanit a omonag no lila no apoy. 
1240468,"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.",Am yaten rana am yata pananalahen o nipanci na ni Ama ta do to a vayo a hanit a kano teyrahem. O ji meyraraten o amyan do dang.
1240469,"Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. ","Am ori an manga kakteh an, no kamo manoyong a yamapananala so araraw ori am makowyowyat kamo pa mapeyvazay so apya vazay a abo so karatan a macikaop ji Ama ta do to. "
1240470,And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; ,"Naknakmen nyo o kaji na angsahan jinyo a pananalahen ni Ama ta do to. Ta ori o avyayan na jinyo, akman so mina ciring ni Pawlo a akma tey kakteh do cinai do teygami na a mangozay do teneng na ni Ama ta do to. "
1240471,"as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.",O akman rana sang am yamamimin do teygami ni Pawlo. Am yaro dang yamasalit a ciring ni Pawlo a yada to peypalasa a yapazsin no yaji macipayok so nakem a tao. Akman so yatatasa ciring do Seysyo a yada patareken a yaononongan.

Ta inarahen ta o icicirawat ni Kizisto no keyyan na pa do teyrahem. 
1240554,There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. ,No katenngan ta rana si Ama ta do to a marilaw nyaten am abo rana o ikanyahey ta. Ta ji na rana pasingkaji yaten ni Ama ta do to.

1240556,"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? ",No amyan so tao a manci no kararalay na ni Ama ta do to a kapacioya na pa do akma ney kakteh do cinai am mangalalas a tao o akman sang.

1240558,Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. ,"O tao rana omanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto a Misayya am manoyong o akman sang a anak na ni Ama ta do to.

1240560,"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. ",O peypeypangayan no kararalay ta ni Ama ta do to am onotan ta o ciring na. Ta jyasalit o ciring na ni Ama ta do to a onotan. 
1240561,"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. ",Mamimin o anak ni Ama ta do to o makaharag so marahet a vazay do karawan. O ipakaharag da so marahet a vazay am voovoo da o kapeyhanhan da ni Yeso Kizisto. 
1240562,"Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? ",Sino sira o makaharag so marahet a vazay do karawan. Omanoyong ji Yeso Kizisto a Anak ni Ama ta do to a tao am ori saon o makaharag sya.
1240563,"This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. ",O nimai do teyrahem a nitaktakan no ranom a nimvoyog so rala am si Yeso Kizisto. O ranom a kano rala na am yongkad no ka Misayya na.

1240566,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. ",Tamo anoyngan o yada ipeylimwang no tao. Am maharahara pa si Ama ta do to a meylimwang no Anak na. 
1240567,He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. ,Am o tao rana omanoyong do Anak na ni Ama ta do to am manoyong keyyan na do onowned na no ciring na ni Ama ta do to.

1240568,"And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. ",O ciring rana nipeylimwang na ni Ama ta do to am nitoro na rana jyaten o to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad ta. Am o yapwan na no nang am Anak na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240569,He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.,O tao a omanoyong do Anak na am amyan jya o to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad na. O ji nganoyong do Anak ni Ama ta do to am abo jya o to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad na.
1240570,"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. ",O ko vatvatkan do jya am ko ipanci jinyo o na rana keyyan jinyo a yaomanoyong do Anak na ni Ama ta do to no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad nyo. 
1240571,"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: ","Abo ikanyahey ta do tangain ni Ama ta do to, ta tamo ipeyhanhan o na kamizing so inozi ta no si pangozayan ta o nakenakem na ni Ama ta do to a mapasyasi jya. "
1240572,"and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. ",Tamo anoyngan o kamizing na so inozi ta ni Ama ta do to a tomoro no amin ta jya.
1240573,"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. ",No makacita kamo so akma nyoy kakteh do cinai a meyraraten am ipeynozi nyo ji Ama ta do to a kavonas na jya kapanta na nya so to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad na.

1240575,"We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. ",Yaten rana anak ni Ama ta do to am ji ta rana ngakdaya o kapeyraraten ta. Ta apzatan ni Yeso Kizisto o onowned ta. So ji na rana makagogaji nyaten ni Satan.

1240577,"And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. ",Tamo katenngan o Anak ni Ama ta do to a yanimai rana a yamanta nyaten so teneteneng ta a ta ipakateneng do manoyong a Tao do to.

1240584,"And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. ",O yako ipanci a pangangarilawan am amizngen ta o ciring na ni Ama ta do to. O nimamizing nyo pa no kakwa a pangangarilawan am patwawen nyo do icicirawat nyo.
1240585,"For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. ",Yamyan so aro a mangnanao no malas a nanao a tao a amlivolivon do karawan. O da patwawen a ciring am da alalasan si Yeso Kizisto a nimalikey do karawan.

1240587,"Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.

1240703,"And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. ",So ji ko nimeyyahahai a nitalamozong no Seyzi. So nipakacita ko na do teyngato so lilisnan no panirsirngen a keyyan no amlisna dang. 
1240704,"And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. ",O keyteytawan no moing na am akman rana so ovay a somilasilaw a kano olo a maniray. So ikatey mazway na citahen. O livolivon na no lilisnan am livonen no nangirang. O keyteytawan na am akmey tamek. 
1240705,"And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. ",Apat so ikasikatlo (24) o lilisnan a amlivon so lilisnan no panirsirngen ang a lisnan no papat so ikakatlwan (24) a kamanrarakehan a meyyayob so malavang a magorogod a kapeysakop da so vowawan. 
1240706,"And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. ",Amyan so to meycicilat a kano gomanazegez a nimapo do lilisnan no panirsirngen a keyyan no apito a ka zampo a amlila do tangain no lilisnan. Ori rana am Seyzi na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240707,"And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. ",Amyan so malavang a panganinwan akman so awa so karakorako do tangain no lilisnan a keyyan no apat a omalalam do sirisiri no lilisnan. O sazapen da kano likod da am makakaday no aro a mata da. 
1240708,"And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. ",O ney manma na omalalam am akma raney kokoman so tao. Ikadwa na am akmey baka. Ikatlo na am moing no tao. Ikapat na am akmey kangkang a to nalasalap. 
1240709,"And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. ","So ikamimin da meykanem so panid no apat a omalalam am tana sazapen na, tana likod na am makakaday no mata na. Sira rana am abo maraw a abo mahep a to da meyyanwanooji.

1240710,"And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, ","O anwanood da no apat a ka omalalam am azwazway a kano keynakem a kano sarasaray a yanood da so to meyyonong a mavyay a omlisna do lilisnan ang. No meyyanwanood sira o omalalam am, "
1240711,"the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, ","meylilitod sira o papat so ikakatlwan (24) a kamanrarakehan a omraralay no to meyyonong a mavyay a omlisna do lilisnan ang a kapangay da so sakop da vowawan do tangain no lilisnan ang.

1240712,"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.","""Panirsirngen namen, Tao do to namen, manoyong ka mahap so azwazway a kano keynakman a kano oyowyat.

1240713,"And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. ",Ko macita o yaomlisna do lilisnan a yameypinan so makowkow a vakong no wanan na.

1240714,"And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? ","Yako kapakacita pa so yatey mowyat a tinsi a yamlolos a yamanci no, ""Sino o makapakaro so nipadketan a vakong a kavezay na sya."" "
1240715,"And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. ",Am tana do teyngato a tana do teyrahem a tana mavyay a tana nimawakwak rana am abo o asa ka tao a makavezay sya vilangan. 
1240716,"And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. ","Ori o nilavi ko, ta abo tao makawasak sya vezain a vilangan so vakong ang. Ta ji pa makanet o onowned da. "
1240717,"And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. ","Karahan am maniring jyaken o asa ka tao do kamanrarakehan am, ""Ji ka lavi. Citahey o Kokoman so tao a yanimakowbot a yapo do iteytetngehan ni Yoda a sivovoong ni Tawey a yarana nimakata.

1240718,"And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. ",Karahan am macita ko o Kagling a amyan do avak no lilisnan a kano apat a ka omalalam a kano kamanrarakehan. O Kagling rana am akma raney niwakwak da a apito so ozong a kapito no mata na.

1240719,And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. ,Karahan am meypasngen o Kagling do sazapen no lilisnan a kahap na so vakong do wanan no amyan do lilisnan ang. 
1240720,"And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. ","Todahen na o vakong no Kagling am meylilitod sira o papat so ikakatlwan (24) a kamanrarakehan a kano apat a ka omalalam do tangain no Kagling a kamimin da no kamanrarakehan a meykaryag a somaray a kaponged da no vowawan a kapnowan no mahangno a haneng. O mahangno a haneng am inozi da ori no manaralay a tao, "
1240721,"And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; ","a kapeyyanwanood da so vayo a anood.

1240722,and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. ,"Imo yada nipamlis a yada to ngonongonongi do kangay da do tangain na ni Ama ta do to a amraralay nya. So talamozongan da no teyrahem no makwa."""
1240723,"And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; ","Karahan am ko pa macita yako kapakamizing so yamakazivo a tinsi a omlivon so lilisnan no Panirsirngen a kano apat a ka omalalam a kano kamanrarakehan, "
1240724,"saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. ","a omlololos a meyyanwanood.

1240725,"And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. ","Karahan am mamizing ko o makakaday a nyamaog na do teyngato a kado teyrahem a kado awa, pacyangayan da no nimawakwak rana tao meyyanwanood.

1240726,"And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.","Maniring sira o apat a ka omalalam am, ""Yamanoyong,"" a kapeylilitod da rana o kamanrarakehan a omraralay nya."
1240727,"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. ","Macita ko o Kagling a mapakaro so ney manma na nipadketan a vakong do makowkow a vakong ang a kapakamizing ko so asa ka omalalam do apat ang a zomaigezeg a akma raney adey. Maniring am, ""Sijya."" "
1240728,"And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.",Citahen ko am macita ko o asa ka malavang a baka. O maoran do baka am meypinan so akmey paltog a mangay macyarap a kapanta da nya so sakop a kangay na rana. So ikanoyong na makata.

1240730,"And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.",Meyratateng am makowbot o asa ka akmey vangkoro a baka.

1240732,"And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.","Akma koy todamizing o ciring da no apat a ka omalalam.

1240734,"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.",Citahen ko am macita ko o baka akman rana so kakawan so keyteytawan.

1240735,"And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: ",Pakarwen na no Kagling o ikalima no nipadketan a vakong am macita ko dobo no patanatanangan so nakem o pahad da no niwakwak da a ji macimaza no kapeylimwang da no ciriciring na ni Ama ta do to.

","Maniring sira amlololos am, ""Mo Panirsirngen a tey mowyat a tey meynakem a manoyong a ipeyhanhan, si mango am pacicin mo a peykapyapinpinen mo o tao do karawan a mangonong nyamen a yada niwakwak."" "
1240737,"And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.","Makarahan am maponged sira no malavang a magorogod a kapakamizing ko so ciring a manci nira meywalam pa, mangay no si mablit rana sira o kararay da a mahap so vazay ni Yeso Kizisto a akma dey kakteh do cinai a akman sira wakwaken da."
1240738,"And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; ",Karahan am macita ko pa o Kagling a mapakaro so ikanem no vakong a nipadketan.

1240739,"and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. ","O mata no hanit rana am makas rana do teyrahem, akman rana so mata pa asi no kayo a nizigzig no pagpag a makas do teyrahem. "
1240740,And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. ,O hanit rana am akma raney vakong a nikowkow a todabo. O tokon a kano mahataw am mablis sira do yanan da. 
1240741,"And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; ","O panipanirsirngen rana do karawan a kano makayokod no teyhesa ka mahataw a kano kabtekan da no panirsirngen no itaysang a kano meynakem a tao a kano peylamsoin da kano to naliway a tao am mamimin sira mangay somazok do meykavavavahay a azcip a kano tokon, "
1240742,"and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: ","a kalololos da do tokotokon a kado pongopongow a manci no, ""Zingboi kamo yamen a taywen a kaji da makacittan jyamen no yasomozi so moing a Kagling a kano yaomlisna do lilisnan a Tao do to.

1240743,For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?,"Ta oya rana o araraw no ipakaranes no da peyoyaoyyan. Sino todavangon do dang."""
1240744,"And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. ",Makarahan am macita ko o apat a ka tinsi a madaday do ngoso no palipalanginan a somengseng do yapwan no meykapat a pagpag a kaji na makaligligisi so yanan no karawan a kano awa kano kayokayo. 
1240745,"And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, ",Macita ko o asa ka tinsi apo do daddan no araw a meypinan so akmey ipadedket a yongkad ni Ama ta do to a amlolos a tomawag do nipanta na ni Ama ta do to so oyowyat a papat a ka tinsi a tey mowyat a to rana mapeykaraherahet so karawan a kano awa.

1240752,"After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; ",Karahan am makacita ko so aro a tao am jyavilangi sira rana apo do peycyamahamahatawan na kano meykataretarek so ciriciring a meytatanek do sazapen no lilisnan a kano Kagling.

1240761,"And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.",Pakarwen no Kagling o ikapito no vakong a nipadketan am kakteb no vatvatek o ji na nimeyminiminiki no teyngato. 
1240762,And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.,Makarahan am macita ko o papito a ka tinsi a meytatanek a maponged no teyhesa ka zapa. 
1240763,"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. ",O asa ka tinsi am mai a meypinan so vowawan a yanan no mahangno a haneng a meytatanek do patanatanangan so nakem.

1240773,"And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!","Citahen ko am mamizing ko o asa ka kangkang a somalap do hanit. Maniring am, ""To sira makasi o tao do teyrahem. Ta da rana avatan no yatatlo a ka tinsi o zapa yavyotan."""
1240774,"And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. ",Avyotan no ikalalima no tinsi o zapa am macita ko o asa ka mata no hanit a makas do teyrahem a kahap na so kagi no abo so takadan a gazawagaw a jyatenngi so karaherahem. 
1240775,"And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. ","Iwangan na no mata no hanit o gazawagaw am mamsot o rako a aob. So ikakedep na rana no araw a bonbonan no rako a aob, "
1240776,"And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. ","a keyyan no zozon a makowbot do aob a makas do teyrahem. So icyakma dey alilipwan a manongit so tao, "
1240777,"And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. ","a keyyan no ciring a manci nya jira so kaji da mapeycyaraherahetan so tamek a kano kayo a kano makakaday a mowamowa. Am apya o kasongit da so jya nitovilan so zozogwan a tao, do kapakatovil da jira a omanop ji Ama ta do to. "
1240778,"And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. ","Am marahet o kato da na patoposan sira, ta kapeyingen da sira so kataotao so kalima vehan. O pakaliliwan da sya am akman rana so nisongit no alilipwan a maninicin. "
1240779,"And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. ",Apyapyahen da pa o kato da na wakwakan do makalima vehan am ji sira wakwak.
1240780,"And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. ",O kamamagenan da no zozon am akma raney omarap a baka. O sakop da am akma raney vowawan. O moing da am akma raney tao. 
1240781,"And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. ",O avok da am akmey avok no mavakes. O ngepen da am akmey ngepen no kokoman so tao. 
1240782,"And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. ",O asot da am akma raney vahalang. No somalap sira am akma raney komsoz a baka a zomaigezeg. 
1240783,"And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. ",Meyyanenbek o ipos da a icyakma dey alilipwan. O ipos da am ori tey rahet a mapeyrarahet so tao so makalima vehan. 
1240784,"And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.",Amyan so asa ka panirsirngen a tomalamozong nira. Iya rana am tinsi a tomalamozong no abo so takadan a gazawagaw a jyatenngi so karaherahem. O ingaran da jya no Sipolay am Apaton. O ingaran da jya no tao do Sila am Apolon.

1240785,"One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.",Mavitos o ney manma na alalaw am amyan pa so meykadwa alalaw a mai.
1240786,"And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, ",Avyotan no ikananem no tinsi am makamizing ko so meyzezyak do livolivon no vowawan a patanatanangan so nakem do tangain ni Ama ta do to. 
1240787,"saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. ","Maniring do ikananem no tinsi a meyzapa am, ""Pasaway rana o yapapat a ka tinsi a nipteng do ayo a yameyngaran so Yovalati."" "
1240788,"And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. ","Karahan am pasawain na rana sira o papat a ka tinsi. Am amyan rana akman sang a nakenakem da a ambalinas so icyakatlo no tao do karawan do awan eya, do vehan eya, do araw eya a sicyacitwai. "
1240789,And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them. ,"O nimamizing ko pa macihza do apat a ka tinsi am yadwa ranaw so kalatolatos (200, 000, 000) sira o tao a maoran do baka itaysang. "
1240790,"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. ",O nimacita ko pa do tateynep ko am aro a baka kano maoran do baka itaysang. O asot da no maoran do baka itaysang am akmey vangkoro a kano mazaponay so keyteytawan a kano akmey kawarey no manok so keyteytawan. O oo no baka am akmey oo no kokoman so tao a keyyan no apoy a kano aob a mamsot do ngoso da. 
1240791,"By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. ",Icyakatlo no tao do karawan o nimawakwak no mamsot do ngongoy no aro a baka apoy a kano aob. 
1240792,"For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. ",O oyowyat da no baka am amyan do ngongoy da kano ipos da. So icyakma ney volay no ipos da a pacitolangan no oo da a mapeyzaza so tao.
1240793,"And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: ","O karwan no tao do karawan a jya nimawakwak no apo do ngongoy no baka am ji da macimazai o kararalay da no kalamsoyan ni Satan a kano ovay a kano gizit a kano vato a kano kayokayo a nyamaog da a ji makacita, ji makamizing, ji makalam. "
1240794,"neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.","Ji da nazidan kapanwakwak da so tao a mangalalas no oyowyat ni Satan, mapeyzavozavoz so tao na a kapanakaw da. So ikabo no pamlimlisan da."
1240795,"And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: ",Nimakacita ko pa so asa ka tey mowyat a tinsi apo do teyngato a meyyayob so cinalab a meysakop so nangirang.

1240796,"and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, ",O lima na am meypinan so mavezay a likta vakong. O asa ka ai na am amzasag do awa. O asa ka ai na am amzasag do kacyan. 
1240797,"and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. ",No amlololos ori am akma raney kokoman so tao so ilololos. No ipisa amlolos am apito o adey a zomaigezeg. 
1240798,"And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. ","Padketen ko o peypeypangayan no apito a ka adey am amyan so ciring a apo do teyngato. Maniring am, ""O peypeypangayan no yapito a ka adey am ji mo meycicicyan. Ji mo padketa."""
1240799,"And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, ","Komavos rana ori am o nimacita ko a tinsi a meytatanek do awa kado kacyan am macita ko rana mapatala so wanan na do teyngato, "
1240800,"and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: ","kasirisiring na si Ama ta do to a nimangamamaog so hanit a kano teyrahem a kano awa kano meycyamadadayan a nyamamaog na. Maniring am, ""Ji rana inini ori. "
1240801,"but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. ","Ta no si omanam pa avyotan no ikapito no tinsi am pangononongan na rana ni Ama ta do to o mina ciring na pa so aro a lamlamsoy na a panoyonoywan na so ciring na."""
1240802,"And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. ","Makarahan am mamizing ko pa o nimamizing ko pa no kakwa apo do teyngato. Maniring am, ""Mangay mo hapen kai mo no yamavezay a vakong do lima no tinsi a yameytatanek do awa kado kacyan."" "
1240803,"And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. ","Mangay ko am ipanci ko o tinsi a tomoro nya jyaken so likta vakong. Maniring jyaken am, ""Hapey a katlen mo nya. Tana meyngen do velek mo am cyaha, ta maganinem do ngoso mo."" "
1240804,"And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. ",Karahan am todahen ko o likta vakong a apo do lima na a kakan ko sya. So nikanoyong no ngoso ko a maganinem. Am itlen ko am todeyngen rana o velek ko. 
1240805,"And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.","Maniring pa jyaken o tinsi am, ""Ipisa ka pa a mangay a mapaziman sya do peycyamahamahatawan na kano meykataretarek a tao a kano meykataretarek so ciriciring a kano aro a panipanirsirngen."""
1240806,"And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. ","Amyan so nimanta nyaken so kayo a dedpang. Maniring jyaken am, ""Tanek a kaktokto mo do yana tankan no yararalayan ni Ama ta do to a kano patanatanangan so nakem a kavilang mo do karwaro da no yamanaralay a tao. "
1240807,"But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. ","Am ji mo aktoktoi o pantaw na, ta o pantaw na am yarana nitoro do beken a tao do Yotay. Sira rana am ipeykaraherahet da o akma ney ili ni Ama ta do to a yadwa so ikasikalima (42) a vehan. "
1240808,"And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. ","Manovoy ko so rarwa ka meyyayob so zaping a tao a yongkad na ni Ama ta do to. Sira rana am ipeylimwang da o ciring na so adwa so ikasikalima (42) vehan."""

1240810,"And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. ",No amyan so tao a amnakenakem so kapeyzaza na sira am to makowbot do ngongoy da o apoy a itemtem da so kavosoyan da a kawakwak da rana. 
1240811,"These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.

1240812,"And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. ",Mateyka da ipanci o ciring na ni Ama ta do to am arapen na sira no omalalam a apo do gazawagaw a kaharag na sira wakwaken. 
1240813,"And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. ",O kataotao da am to rana nangyan do rarahan do rako a ili. Do dang rana am nipadketan da so Panirsirngen ta do jyojika. O pehngehngayan da so ngaran no ili am Sotoma kano Ayci. 
1240814,"And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. ",O nimapo do peycyeytetngehan a tao a kano peycyeylilyan a kano meykataretarek so ciriciring a kano peycyamahamahatawan na am mangay da citahen o kataotao da so kasisi so ikapat a araw.

1240815,"And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. ","Somaray o tao do teyrahem a makacita sira a nimawakwak rana. Macyazazaw sira somaray, ta nimapo do rarwa ka lamlamsoy na ni Ama ta do to o alalaw no tao do karawan. "
1240816,"And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. ",Mavitos rana o kasisi so ikapat a araw am avyain na rana sira ni Ama ta do to. Ori o nipeyvangon da rana. Am ori o nikanyahey da no tao a makacita sira tomanek.

1240818,"And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.",Karahan am meykanini.

1240828,"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

1240848,"And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. ",So to na rana myapyai sya amgogad no omanop ji Ama ta do to a tao a iharag na sira.

1240849,"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. ",O tao rana do karawan a jidket so ngaran do vakong no niwakwak da Kagling a yanan na rana no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da tao am ori o amraralay nya.

1240850,"If any man have an ear, let him hear. ",O meycicilwan a tao am amizngen nyo an. 
1240851,He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.,O ipanci a vaoden am mangay kavaod sira an. O ipanci a mahap so inawan no ipangan am mangay kangay no inawan da no ipangan. So ikamimin da no amraralay ni Ama ta do to a ji macizizikna do kapeyhanhan da nya.
1240852,"And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. ",Makacita ko pa so asa ka omalalam a apo do oned no tana. Ori rana am adwa ozong na akman rana so ozong no kagling. Am o izezyak na am akman rana so kamolay. 
1240853,"And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. ",Amyan ori do tangain no nimanmanma a omalalam a mapeyvazay so rako a oyowyat no nimanma a omalalam ang. Iya rana am gacigatan na o tao do karawan mangay omraralay no nimapya rana so nipeyzazan a omalalam ang. 
1240854,"And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, ",Meyvazay o ikadwa na no omalalam so mapangyangyalak a vazay am pakasen na o apoy a apo do teyngato do tangain no aro a tao. 
1240855,"and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. ",So nipakahap na so rako a oyowyat a meyvazay so mapangyangyalak a vazay do tangain no nimanma na omalalam. Am ori o nilittan na do tao do karawan. Ipanci na o tao do karawan a mamaring so kamamagenan no nimatavaz no ipangan a omalalam. 
1240856,"And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. ",Makahap o ikadwa na no omalalam so rako a oyowyat am avyain na o akma ney keyteytawan no nimanma na omalalam. So nipeyzezyak na rana a kawakwak na so ji raralay nya a tao. 
1240857,"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: ","Karahan am gacigatan na o aro a tao, tana meynakem a tana jyeynakem, a tana makcin a tana mabsoy, a tana peylamsoin da kano ji da peylamsoyan, miminen na o wanan da kano zozogwan da tovilan. "
1240858,"and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. ",O ipadedket am vilang a ngaran na no omalalam. O jya nipadketan am ji makasazang so kanen na. Ji makapalit no apzapzatan na so ileylamnay na so nakem.
1240859,Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.,O mateneng a tao am to da na tenngi o peypeypangayan no vilang a ngaran no omalalam.

1240860,"And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads. ","Macita ko pa o Kagling a meytatanek do meyngaran so Sian a tokon. O macihza jya tao am yamyan so ikakapatan da ranaw so ikalima da zivo no ikadwa da latos (144, 000) no tao.

1240861,"And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: ",O nimamizing ko a ciring a apo do teyngato am akma raney azda kano adey a zomaigezeg. O nimamizing ko pa am akma raney meykaryag. 
1240862,"and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. ","Sira rana am meytatanek sira do sazapen no lilisnan a kano apat a ka omalalam a kano kamanrarakehan a meyyanwanood so vayo a anood.

1240863,"These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. ",Sira rana am ji nagpyan so aktokto sira a macilocilolo do angayan no Kagling.

1240864,And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.,Ji pa nimangalalas sira. So ikanoyong da abo so kararatan.
1240865,"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, ",Macita ko o tinsi am somalap do hanit.

1240866,"saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.","Maniring a amlololos am, ""Anooden nyo si Ama ta do to a iraralay.

1240867,"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.","Maniring o ikararwa no tinsi am, ""Yarana mabalinas o rako a ili a meyngaran so Papilon.

1240868,"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, ","Maniring o ikatatlo no tinsi a amlololos am, ""O amraralay no omalalam a kano kamamagenan na nipadketan rana so zozogwan a kano lima am, "
1240869,"the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: ",ayopen da o masozi a saki ni Ama ta do to.

O paglowan na so ayoyopen no peyoyaoyyan na am pasingsingkadan na sira do tangain no aro a tinsi a kano Kagling a matemtem no lila no apoy. 
1240870,"and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. ","O amrahet so kangangay da aob am jimtad a meypangay do teyngato.

1240872,"And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.","Makamizing ko pa so ciring a apo do teyngato.

1240873,"And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. ",Meyratateng am makacita ko so asa ka malavang a cinalab a lisnan no akma raney tao a meysakop so vowawan a meypinan so matarem a kekezdas. 
1240874,"And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. ","O asa ka tinsi am makowbot a apo do panaralayan a tomawag do omlisna do cinalab ang. Maniring a amlololos am, ""Yarana marateng o araraw na.

1240875,And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.,Karahan am langin na rana no kekezdas na no amlisna do cinalab ang a kalangi na rana so mowamowa na do teyrahem.
1240876,"And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. ","Makacita ko pa so asa ka tinsi a apo do panaralayan a makowbot. Akman sang ori, ta meypinan so matarem a kekezdas."
1240877,"And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. ","Karahan am amyan so asa ka tinsi a tomalamozong no apoy a meytotwaw a apo do patanatanangan so nakem a tomawag do meypinan so matarem a kekezdas a tinsi.

1240878,"And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. ",Meyratateng am langin na rana no tinsi no kekezdas do teyrahem a tomavaz so potaw a asi no kayo a kapangay na sya do pangangatesan so saki. Ori rana am peyoyaoyyan ni Ama ta do to.

1240880,"And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.",Citahen ko am amyan so macitarek a mapangyangyalak.

1240881,"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.

1240882,"And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.

1240884,"And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: ",Komavos ori am macita ko do teyngato o panaralayan a meywang. Amyan do sahad na so peyheyhekasan na ni Ama ta do to. 
1240885,"and the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. ",O tomalamozong no apito a ka alalaw a tinsi am makowbot a apo do panaralayan a meyyayob so maniray a ayob. O vatavat da am mibtek so vowawan. 
1240886,"And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. ",O asa do apat a ka omalalam am itoro na o apito a ka vowawan a panay do papito a tinsi a kapnowan no oyaoya no to meyyonong a Tao do to. 
1240887,"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.",O panaralayan na am kapnowan no aob a apo do azwazway a kano oyowyat ni Ama ta do to.

1240888,"And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.","Makamizing ko so ciring a amlololos a apo do sahad no panaralayan a somirisiring so papito a ka tinsi.

1240889,"And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.",Mangay o ney manma na tinsi am paglowen na o panay na do teyrahem.

1240890,And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.,O tomonton a tinsi am paglowen na o panay na do awa. Karahan am meyvaliw o awa akmey rala no nimawakwak a tao. Ori o nikamimin no masaod no awa a mawakwak.
1240891,And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. ,O ikatatlo da no tinsi am paglowen na o panay na do ayo a kado atbodan no ranom. Karahan am meyvaliw o ranom a rala. 
1240892,"And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.

1240895,And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. ,Paglowen no ikapapat no tinsi o panay na do araw am to rana manemtem so tao o azidangdang no araw. 
1240896,"And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.",O tao am kakwatan no azidangdang no araw.

1240897,"And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, ","O ikalalima no tinsi am paglowen na o panay na do lilisnan no omalalam ang a apo do awa.

1240899,"And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. ",O ikananem no tinsi am paglowen na o panay na do ayo a meyngaran so Yovalati. Meyratateng am to rana akehang do kapeypalanginan na no apo do daddan no araw a panipanirsirngen so rarahan da.

1240905,"And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. ","Meyratateng am meycicilat a kapeykadey na, kapeykanini na. Am abo pa o akman sang so karakorako a kanini. "
1240906,"And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.

1240984,And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. ,Makarahan am patwawen na no awa o nimawakwak a tao. Akman sang o kacyan a mapatwaw so nimawakwak a tao so pahad. Sira rana am to macilocilolo do mina raraten da no keyyan da pa do karawan o pacicyan na sira. 
1240985,And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. ,Karahan am balinasen na o kawakwakan a iwalit do akman so awa so karakorako a lila no apoy. O apoy rana am ipirwa kawakwak. 
1240986,And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.,O abo so ngaran do vakong a adketan no ngarangaran da no yanan na rana no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da am iwalit na sira do akman so awa so karakorako a lila no apoy.
1240987,And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. ,Makarahan am makacita ko so vayo a hanit a kano vayo a teyrahem. O nimanmanma hanit a kano teyrahem am ji rana cita. Akman sang o awa a ji rana cita. 
1240988,"And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. ",Makarahan am macita ko o ili na ni Ama ta do to.

1240989,"And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.

1240990,"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. ","Linasan na ni Ama ta do to o kaoo da. Abo rana o mawakwak. Abo rana mazabab so onowned a kano amlavi so onowned a kano meyngen. So ikanoyong na rana komavos no mina vazay no kakwa."""

1240994,"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.","Am sira rana manyahey a tao a kano ji nganoyong jyaken a tao a kano somagpyan a kano manwakwak a kano mangzakza so icyatatao da kano manlita no oyowyat ni Satan a kano manaralay so malas a iraralay a kano mangalalas a tao am amyan so akmey awa so karakorako a lila no apoy a omapanala sira.

1240995,"And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

1240996,"And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, ",So nitalamozongan na nyaken no Seyzi. Makarahan am yangay na yaken no tinsi do toktok no tokon a kapacita na nya jyaken so apo ji Ama ta do to a nimeygegcin do teyrahem a Yelosaleng. 
1240997,"having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; ",O rako a ili rana am yanan no azwazway ni Ama ta do to. So icyakma na raney olo a maniray. No maniray am akma raney panganinwan. 
1240998,"and had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: ",Amyan so makarang a atoy. O atoy rana am adwa o icyarwa na no pangengneban na a pamzatan no rarwa so ikakarwan a tinsi. O pangengneban am domket o ngaran da no rarwa so ikakarwan a iteytetngehan da no Isedi a tao. 
1240999,on the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. ,O teyhesa ka mocimot na am atlo o pangengneban. Nikakaday da o pangengneban a nipasazap da do palapalanginan. 
1241000,"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. ",O abneken na soil no atoy am adwa o icyarwa no lalitan a kakakadayan no ngaran da no nipamnekan no Kagling a amlivolivon no ciriciring na.
1241001,"And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. ",O macisirsiring jyaken a tinsi am meypinan so vowawan a ipangtokto a ivitong na do rako a ili a kano pangengneban na kano atoy na. 
1241002,"And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. ",Akma raney kavangan o ili so keyteytawan. O kanaronaro na kano kowvowvong na kano kakarakarang na am meyyangangay. Kaptepteng na rana jya no tinsi. Aptengan na am makanateng a zivo o kananet na. So icyakman na sang no kowvowvong na kano kakarakarang na. 
1241003,"And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. ",No to na mangozai no tinsi o ipamtepteng no tao do karawan a idpang na do atoy no ili am o kakarakarang na am kakteb o ikapat na anet. 
1241004,"And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. ",O nipeyyatoy da am lalitan. O nyamaog da so ili da am meyngongyod a vowawan. So icyakma na raney panganinwan a to rana pengkad. 
1241005,"And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. ",O soil na no atoy no ili am pangayan da so ikadwa na so icyarwa no makakaday a masingat a lalitan a yazwazway da sya. O soil na no atoy no ili am pangayan da so ikadwa na so icyarwa no makakaday a masingat a lalitan a yazwazway da sya. 
1241006,"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. ",O peypeypangayan na no yadwa so icyarwa a pangengneban na am adwa so icyarwa a masingat a lalitan. Mamimin o teyhesa ka pangengneban a nyamaog no masingat a lalitan.

1241007,And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. ,Abo do ili o nimacita ko a panaralayan. Ta si Ama ta do to rana kano Kagling o iraralay da do dang. 
1241008,"And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. ","O ili rana am tana abo o araw a kano vehan am cyaha, ta cirain na sira no oyowyat na ni Ama ta do to. So peyyapoyan da so Kagling no tao do ili. "
1241009,And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. ,Mamimin o peycyamahamahatawan do karawan a mangonong do cirain na. O panipanirsirngen do karawan am mamimin sira mai no keynakman da do ili eya. 
1241010,And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there. ,"Kasaraw a todeywang o pangengneban. So to na meyyonongi a meywang, ta abo do dang o mahep. "
1241011,And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. ,O keynakman da kano azwazway da no peycyamahamahatawan am miminen da yai do ili eya. 
1241012,"And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.",Am o meyraraten a kano marahet so iwawalam a kano mangalalas am ji sira makasdep. O amyan so ngaran do vakong no Kagling a yanan rana no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad da am ori o makasdep.
1241013,"And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. ",Makarahan am ipacita na pa jyaken no tinsi o asa ka ayo a yapwan no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad a to meylacilat a akma raney panganinwan a apo do lilisnan ni Ama ta do to a kano Kagling. 
1241014,"In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. ",O ranom rana am amvoyog a mangonong do rarahan do avak no ili. O sigisigil na no ayo am amyan so kayo a tomanek do dang a yapwan no to meyyonong a ikavyay no pahad.

1241015,And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: ,Abo rana do ili ya o ikaoya na ni Ama ta do to. So ikanoyong na rana no lilisnan ni Ama ta do to a kano Kagling a amyan rana do ili a kararalay da nya no lamlamsoy na. 
1241016,and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. ,Sira rana am pacimatan da rana o moing na ni Ama ta do to. O ngaran na ni Ama ta do to am domket do zozogwan da. 
1241017,"And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.","Abo rana do dang o mahep.

1241018,"And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.
